            <p><strong>Preparatory steps </strong></p>
            <p>Giving a talk or presentation about animal rights? Follow these five steps to make sure you give an informative and effective speech every time.</p>
            <h1>Step 1: Research and Preparation</h1>
            <p>Consider the audience that you will be speaking to, and make sure that the tone and information is appropriate for that audience. Try to put yourself in their shoes, and think about what you want the outcome of your speech to be (e.g., to get people to go vegan or to adopt an animal instead of buying one).&nbsp;</p>
            <h1>Step 2: Writing Your Speech</h1>
            <p>Before you begin writing, make a list of two to five main points that you want to present. Write out each point in one or two sentences.</p>
            <p>Your speech will be most effective if you plan your opening and closing statements and key transitions down to the last word. Organize the speech logically with a beginning, a middle, and an end. In other words, tell your audience what you&rsquo;re going to tell them, tell them it, and then summarize what you&rsquo;ve told them.</p>
            <p>Here are some other quick tips:</p>

            <p>STRUCTURING A CONTENT</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Making an impact in a presentation or a speech can seem out of reach. However, everyone is capable of delivering a show-stopping performance, and in this article we breakdown the first step - creating quality and engaging content - nothing will do more for your confidence than knowing you have prepared effectively.</p>
            <p>Follow our four presentation tips to create a bespoke presentation to capture your audience.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Establish a clear intention</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Ask yourself two simple questions: What is my goal? And, what message do I want my audience to receive? Establishing a 'through-line' for your speech will keep you on track.</p>
            <ol start="2">
              <li>Make it relevant</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Audiences will engage so much more with your ideas if you tailor your presentation to their interests. Before you get started, follow these four steps:</p>
            <p>Research your audience - why are they here? What do they care about?</p>
            <p>Adapt your approach - keep questioning 'How can I connect?'..'How do I want them to react?'</p>
            <p>Mix it up - if you present regularly, think about how you can freshen things up for different audiences and their needs.</p>
            <p>Stay on point - clarify your objective, never lose sight of it and shape all of your content around it.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol start="3">
              <li>Tell Stories</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Your audience will remember the content better if you include stories in your speech.</p>
            <p>Even if facts and figures are important for your content, structure them around a narrative which engages the audience. Try beginning with an interesting fact, a bold claim or by asking them a question. Add points of contrasts, and use anecdotes to break up heavy content and draw attention back to you.</p>
            <p>Beginning. Middle. End.</p>
            <ol start="4">
              <li>Slide Rules</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In a presentation your slides are there to help you, but don't let them steal the show. Remember these rules:</p>
            <p>5/5/5 - no more than five words per line, five lines per slide, five text-heavy slides in a row.</p>
            <p>Picture this - use images to support your message and keep it light.</p>
            <p>Size matters- use a legible type size and remember a screen is very different to your monitor.</p>
            <p>Keep it simple - don't overuse effects to make your presentation more interesting (rely on your content to do this instead.)</p>
            <p>Remember - delivering a convincing presentation or speech that engages the audience is no different to any other type of performance: the only secret is good preparation.</p>

            <h1>Audience Awareness</h1>
            <p>The audience of a technical writing&mdash;or any piece of writing for that matter&mdash;is the intended or potential reader or readers. For most technical writers, this is the most important consideration in planning, writing, and reviewing a document. You &ldquo;adapt&rdquo; your writing to meet the needs, interests, and background of the readers who will be reading your writing. In reality, the lack of audience analysis and adaptation is one of the root causes of most of the problems you find in professional, technical documents&mdash;particularly instructions where it surfaces most glaringly.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Once you&rsquo;ve read this chapter on audiences, try using the audience planner found at the end of this chapter. You fill in blanks with answers to questions about your audience. Use the audience planner for any writing project as a way of getting yourself to think about your audience in detail.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h1>Types of Audiences</h1>
            <p>One of the first things to do when you analyze an audience is to identify its type (or types&mdash; it&rsquo;s rarely just one type). The common division of audiences into categories is as follows:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Experts: These are the people who know the business or organization (and possibly the theory and the product) inside and out. They designed it, they tested it, they know everything about it. Often, they have advanced degrees and operate in academic settings or in research and development areas of the government and technology worlds.</p>
            <p>Technicians: These are the people who build, operate, maintain, and repair the items that the experts design and theorize about. Theirs is a highly technical knowledge as well, but of a more practical nature.</p>
            <p>Executives: These are the people who make business, economic, administrative, legal, governmental, political decisions about the products of the experts and technicians. Executives are likely to have as little technical knowledge about the subject as nonspecialists. For many of you, this will be the primary audience.</p>
            <p>Nonspecialists: These readers have the least technical knowledge of all. They want to use the new product to accomplish their tasks; they want to understand the new power technology enough to know whether to vote for or against it in the upcoming bond election. Or, they may just be curious about a specific technical matter and want to learn about it&mdash;but for no specific, practical reason. Chances are, these readers will represent your secondary audience.</p>
            <p>Audience Analysis</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s important to determine which of the four categories just discussed represent your potential audience(s), but that&rsquo;s not the end of it. Audiences, regardless of category, must also be analyzed in terms of characteristics such as the following:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Background&mdash;knowledge, experience, training: One of your most important concerns is just how much knowledge, experience, or training you can expect in your readers. If you expect some of your readers to lack certain background, do you automatically supply it in your document? Consider an example: imagine you are writing a guide to using a software product that runs under Microsoft Windows. How much can you expect your readers to know about Windows? If some are likely to know little about Windows, should you provide that information? If you say no, then you run the risk of customers getting frustrated with your product. If you say yes to adding background information on Windows, you increase your work effort and add to the page count of the document (and thus to the cost). Obviously, there&rsquo;s no easy answer to this question&mdash;part of the answer may involve just how small a segment of the audience needs that background information.</p>
            <p>Needs and interests: To plan your document, you need to know what your audience is going to expect from that document. Imagine how readers will want to use your document; what they will demand from it. For example, imagine you are writing a manual on how to use a new smartphone&mdash;what are your readers going to expect to find in it? Imagine you are under contract to write a background report on global warming for a national real estate association&mdash;what do readers want to read about; and, equally important, what do they not want to read about?</p>
            <p>Other demographic characteristics: And of course there are many other characteristics about your readers that might have an influence on how you should design and write your document&mdash;for example, age groups, type of residence, area of residence, gender, political preferences, and so on.</p>
            <p>Audience analysis can get complicated by at least two other factors: mixed audience types for one document, wide variability within audience, and unknown audiences.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>More than one audience: You are likely to find that your report is for more than one audience. For example, it may be seen by technical people (experts and technicians) and administrative people (executives). What should you do in this case? You can either write all the sections so that all the audiences of your document can understand them. Or you can write each section strictly for the audience that would be interested in it, then use headings and section introductions to alert your audience about where to find relevant information in your report.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h1>Mode of Delivery</h1>
            <p>There are four basic methods (sometimes called styles) of presenting a speech: manuscript, memorized, extemporaneous, and impromptu. Each has a variety of uses in various forums of communication.</p>
            <h2>Manuscript Style</h2>
            <p>The word manuscript is the clue to the style. The speech is written and the speaker reads it word for word to the audience. Originally, it was done from the hand-written paper manuscript. Today the manuscript style is common, but the paper is gone. Who reads the speech to the audience? Answer: Newscasters and television personalities. In the old days, the manuscript was hand-lettered on cue cards, which were held next to the camera lens. Then paper scrolls, like printed piano rolls were used, especially in Soap Operas. Today, a special teleprompter (working like a periscope) is attached to the camera so the newscaster is looking at the lens while reading.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Memorized Style</p>
            <p>The memorized style of speaking is when the manuscript is committed to memory and recited to the audience verbatim (word for word). In the days when elocution was taught, this was a typical approach. A speech was a recitation. The Optimists Club (a national organization) used to have a &ldquo;Oratory&rdquo; contest for high school students. Contestants wrote essays on a given theme, to create a speech at a specific time length (e.g.: three minutes). The essay was memorized and the delivery was judged by 1) the quality of the writing, 2) the accuracy with which it was recited; and 3) the precise length of time. Such contests seem archaic by today&rsquo;s more casual and somewhat less formal standards.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Impromptu Style</p>
            <p>Theoretically, an &ldquo;impromptu&rdquo; speech is &ldquo;made up on the spot.&rdquo; It is unprepared and unrehearsed. Often ceremonial toasts, grace before meals, an acknowledgement, an introduction, offering thanks and so on, fall into this category. While there are some occasions when a speech in those categories is actually prepared (prepare your acceptance for the Academy Award BEFORE you are called!), there are many occasions when there is little or no opportunity to prepare.</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <h3><strong>Extemporaneous Style </strong></h3>
            <p>Sandwiched between the <em>memorized</em> and <em>impromptu</em> delivery styles you find the extemporaneous speech style. For this style, the speech is not completely written out. It is usually delivered with keynotes for reference. Most public speaking courses and books describe <strong>extemporaneous</strong> speeches as carefully prepared and rehearsed, but delivered using notes of key words and phrases to support the speaker. Phrasing is pre- rehearsed, words are pre-chosen, and the organization is fluid and well constructed. There should be no fumbling for words, no rambling, and length of time should be carefully monitored. The style does offer the speaker flexibility to include references to the immediate surroundings, previous speeches, news of the day, and so on.</p>
            <h2>Vocal Aspects of Delivery</h2>
            <p>Though we speak frequently during the course of a day, a formal speech requires extra attention to detail in preparation of a more formal speech presentation. What can one do in advance to prepare for a speech? The challenge is partly determined by the speaker&rsquo;s experience, background and sometimes cultural influence and existing habits of speaking. Articulation, Pronunciation, Dialect, Tone, Pitch, and Projection each depends on long-term practice for success. These aspects are like signatures, and should be developed and used by each speaker according to his own persona.</p>
            <p>Voice, or vocal sound, is made when controlled air being exhaled from the lungs, passes over the vocal cords causing a controlled vibration. The vibrating air resonates in the body, chest cavity, mouth, and nasal passages. The vibrating air causes a chain reaction with the air in the room. The room&rsquo;s air, set in motion by the voice, is captured by the listener&rsquo;s ear. The vibration of the air against the eardrum is transferred to electrical impulses that are interpreted by the listener&rsquo;s brain. Thus, the sounds we can make are predicated on the breaths that we take.</p>
            <p>Articulation</p>
            <p>We are often judged by how well we speak in general. A measure of perceived intellect or education is how well we articulate. That is: how well and correctly we form our vowels and consonants using our lips, jaw, tongue, and palate to form the sounds that are identified as speech. Diction and enunciation are other terms that refer to the same idea. For instance, saying &ldquo;going to&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;gonna&rdquo; or &ldquo;did not&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;dint&rdquo; are examples of good versus poor articulation. Consonant and vowels are spoken with standard accepted precision, and serious students and speakers will strive to practice the clarity of their sounds. Proper diction is as integral to the English language as proper spelling, but it takes practice.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Pronunciation</p>
            <p>Proper articulation applied to a given word is that word&rsquo;s pronunciation. The pronunciation includes how the vowels and consonants are produced as well as which syllable is emphasized. For generations, speakers depended on &ldquo;markings (such as the International Phonetics Alphabet or similar Dictionary Symbols) to discover or decide how words were officially pronounced. With online dictionaries now readily available, one needs only to &ldquo;look up&rdquo; a word and select &ldquo;play&rdquo; to hear an audible recording of the official and precise way a word should be pronounced. Now there is no excuse for mispronouncing a word in a speech. A mispronounced word will obliterate a speaker&rsquo;s credibility, and the audience&rsquo;s attention will be focused on the fault rather than the message.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Accent, Dialect, and Regionalisms</p>
            <p>Subtleties in the way we pronounce words and phrase our speech within a given language are evident in accents, regionalisms, and dialects. An accent refers to the degree of prominence of the way syllables are spoken in words, as when someone from Australia says</p>
            <p>&ldquo;undah&rdquo; whereas we say &ldquo;under.&rdquo; A regionalism is a type of expression, as when someone says &ldquo;The dog wants walked,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;the dog wants to go for a walk.&rdquo; Dialect is a variety of language where one is distinguished from others by grammar and vocabulary. In</p>
            <p>Pennsylvania you might hear people say that they are going to &ldquo;red up the room,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;to clean the room.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Those who depend on speaking for a career (broadcasters, politicians, and entertainers) will often strive for unaccented General or Standard English. Listen to most major network newscasters for examples of regionalism-free speech. A given audience may be prejudiced towards or against a speaker with an identifiable accent or dialect. Though we would wish prejudice were not the case, the way we speak implies so much about our education, cultural background, and economic status, that prejudice is inevitable. Any speaker should be aware of how accent, dialect, and regionalisms can be perceived by a given audience. If you speak in a way that the audience might find difficult to understand, make an extra effort to pay attention to the accent and phrasing of your speech. Ask a sympathetic and objective listener to help you when you practice.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Vocal Quality</p>
            <p>The quality of the voice, its timbre (distinctive sound) and texture, affects audibility and can affect the articulation. Our voices are unique to each of us. It is a result of our physical vocal instrument, including diaphragm, vocal cords, lungs and body mass. Some examples of vocal quality include warm, clear, soft, scratchy, mellow and breathy. Each speaker should practice at maximizing the vocal effect of his instrument, which can be developed with vocal exercises. There are numerous books, recordings and trainers available to develop one&rsquo;s vocal quality when needed. The quality of one&rsquo;s voice is related to its range of pitch.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Pitch and Inflection</p>
            <p>Identical to musical parlance, the pitch is the &ldquo;highness&rdquo; or &ldquo;lowness&rdquo; of the voice. Each of us has a range oftone. Vocal sounds are actually vibrations sent out from the vocal cords resonating through chambers in the body. The vibrations can literally be measured in terms of audio frequency in the same way music is measured. When the pitch is altered to convey a meaning (like raising the pitch at the end of a sentence that is a question), it is the inflection. Inflections are variations, turns and slides in pitch to achieve the meaning.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In his writing &ldquo;Poetics,&rdquo; Aristotle lists &ldquo;Music&rdquo; as an element of the Drama. Some scholars interpret that to include the musicalization of the spoken word with dramatic inflection. The meaning and effectiveness of a spoken line is greatly dependent on the &ldquo;melody&rdquo; of its inflection.</p>
            <p>Though archaic, the study of elocution formalizes the conventions of inflection. In some contemporary cultures, inflection has been minimized because it sounds too &ldquo;melodramatic&rdquo; for the taste of the demographic group. It would be sensible to be aware of and avoid both extremes. With good animated inflection, a speaker is more interesting, and the inflection conveys energy and &ldquo;aliveness&rdquo; that compels the audience to listen.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Pauses Versus Vocalized Pauses</p>
            <p>A text that is read has punctuation that the reader can see&hellip;miniature landmarks to define the text. When spoken, similar punctuation is needed for comprehension, and the speaker&rsquo;s responsibility is to offer the text with pauses. Space between phrases, properly planted, gives the audience the opportunity to understand the structure of the speaker&rsquo;s sentences and paragraphs. It also gives time for the audience to &ldquo;digest&rdquo; crucial phrases.</p>
            <p>Generally, spoken sentences and paragraphs need to be simpler and shorter than what can be comprehended by reading. Pauses can help increase comprehension.</p>
            <p>However, pauses that are filled with &ldquo;uh&rsquo;s, &ldquo;um&rsquo;s,&rdquo; etc., are called vocalized pauses, or fillers, and should be avoided. They can be distracting and annoying, and give the impression of a lack of preparation if used excessively. Even worse is the use of vernacular phrases like, &ldquo;y&rsquo;know&rdquo; (a contraction of &ldquo;Do You Know&rdquo;) which gives the impression of lack of education or lack of concern for the audience. The use of vocalized pauses may be the result of a habit that deserves an effort to be overcome. Avoid using phrases such as &ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; &ldquo;OK?&rdquo;, &ldquo;y&rsquo;know&rdquo;, &ldquo;like&hellip;, I mean,&rdquo; &ldquo;right?&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <h3><strong>Vocal Projection </strong></h3>
            <p>The volume produced by the vocal instrument is projection. Supporting the voice volume with good breathing and energy can be practiced, and helping a speaker develop the correct volume is a main task of a vocal trainer, teacher or coach. Good vocal support with good posture, breathing, and energy should be practiced regularly, long before a speech is delivered. There are numerous exercises devoted to developing projection capabilities.</p>
            <p>While there is no need to shout, a speaker should project to be easily heard from the furthest part of the audience. Even if the speech is amplified with a microphone/sound system, one must speak with projection and energy. As with your rate of speech, you should speak at a volume that comfortably allows you to increase the volume of your voice without seeming to shout or decrease the volume of your voice and still be heard by all audience members.</p>
            <p>Do not expect to walk up to the podium and have a full voice. Actors spend about a half-hour doing vocal warm-ups, and singers warm up much more. You might not have an opportunity to warm up immediately before your speech, but when you can, warm up with humming, yawning (loudly) or singing scales: all while breathing deeply and efficiently. It will loosen your voice, prevent irritation, and fire up your vocal energy.</p>

            <h3>SPEECHES FOR DIFFERENT OCCASIONS</h3>
            <p>Many entertaining speeches fall under the category of special-occasion speeches. All the speeches in this category are given to mark the significance of particular events. Common events include weddings, bar mitzvahs, awards ceremonies, funerals, and political events. In each of these different occasions, speakers are asked to deliver speeches relating to the event. For purposes of simplicity, we&rsquo;ve broken special-occasion speeches into two groups: ceremonial speaking and inspirational speaking.</p>
            <p>Ceremonial Speaking</p>
            <p>Ceremonial speeches are speeches given during a ceremony or a ritual marked by observance of formality or etiquette. These ceremonies tend to be very special for people, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising that they are opportunities for speech making. Let&rsquo;s examine each of the eight types of ceremonial speaking: introductions, presentations, acceptances, dedications, toasts, roasts, eulogies, and farewells.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speeches of Introduction</p>
            <p>The first type of speech is called the speech of introduction, which is a minispeech given by the host of a ceremony that introduces another speaker and his or her speech. Few things are worse than when the introducer or a speaker stands up and says, &ldquo;This is Joe Smith, he&rsquo;s going to talk about stress.&rdquo; While we did learn the speaker&rsquo;s name and the topic, the introduction falls flat. Audiences won&rsquo;t be the least bit excited about listening to Joe&rsquo;s speech.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Just like any other speech, a speech of introduction should be a complete speech and have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion&mdash;and you should do it all in under two minutes. This brings up another &ldquo;few things are worse&rdquo; scenario: an introductory speaker who rambles on for too long or who talks about himself or herself instead of focusing on the person being introduced.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For an introduction, think of a hook that will make your audience interested in the upcoming speaker. Did you read a news article related to the speaker&rsquo;s topic? Have you been impressed by a presentation you&rsquo;ve heard the speaker give in the past? You need to find something that can grab the audience&rsquo;s attention and make them excited about hearing the main speaker.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The body of your introductory speech should be devoted to telling the audience about the speaker&rsquo;s topic, why the speaker is qualified, and why the audience should listen (notice we now have our three body points). First, tell your audience in general terms about the overarching topic of the speech. Most of the time as an introducer, you&rsquo;ll only have a speech title and maybe a paragraph of information to help guide this part of your speech. That&rsquo;s all right. You don&rsquo;t need to know all the ins and outs of the main speaker&rsquo;s speech; you just need to know enough to whet the audience&rsquo;s appetite. Next, you need to tell the audience why the speaker is a credible speaker on the topic. Has the speaker written books or articles on the subject? Has the speaker had special life events that make him or her qualified? Lastly, you need to briefly explain to the audience why they should care about the upcoming speech.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The final part of a good introduction is the conclusion, which is generally designed to welcome the speaker to the lectern. Many introducers will conclude by saying something like, &ldquo;I am looking forward to hearing how Joe Smith&rsquo;s advice and wisdom can help all of us today, so please join me in welcoming Mr. Joe Smith.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve known some presenters who will even add a notation to their notes to &ldquo;start clapping&rdquo; and &ldquo;shake speakers hand&rdquo; or &ldquo;give speaker a hug&rdquo; depending on the circumstances of the speech.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Now that we&rsquo;ve walked through the basic parts of an introductory speech, let&rsquo;s see one outlined:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Specific Purpose: To entertain the audience while preparing them for Janice Wright&rsquo;s speech on rituals.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Introduction: Mention some common rituals people in the United States engage in (Christmas, sporting events, legal proceedings).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Main Points:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Explain that the topic was selected because understanding how cultures use ritual is an important part of understanding what it means to be human.</p>
            <p>Janice Wright is a cultural anthropologist who studies the impact that everyday rituals have on communities.</p>
            <p>All of us engage in rituals, and we often don&rsquo;t take the time to determine how these rituals were started and how they impact our daily routines.</p>
            <p>Conclusion: I had the opportunity to listen to Dr. Wright at the regional conference in Springfield last month, and I am excited that I get to share her with all of you tonight. Please join me in welcoming Dr. Wright (start clapping, shake speaker&rsquo;s hand, exit stage).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speeches of Presentation</p>
            <p>The second type of common ceremonial speech is the speech of presentation. A speech of presentation is a brief speech given to accompany a prize or honor. Speeches of presentation can be as simple as saying, &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s recipient of the Schuman Public Speaking prize is Wilhelmina Jeffers,&rdquo; or could last up to five minutes as the speaker explains why the honoree was chosen for the award.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When preparing a speech of presentation, it&rsquo;s always important to ask how long the speech should be. Once you know the time limit, then you can set out to create the speech itself. First, you should explain what the award or honor is and why the presentation is important. Second, you can explain what the recipient has accomplished in order for the award to be bestowed. Did the person win a race? Did the person write an important piece of literature? Did the person mediate conflict? Whatever the recipient has done, you need to clearly highlight his or her work. Lastly, if the race or competition was conducted in a public forum and numerous people didn&rsquo;t win, you may want to recognize those people for their efforts as well. While you don&rsquo;t want to steal the show away from winner (as Kanye West did to Taylor Swift during the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speeches of Acceptance</p>
            <p>The complement to a speech of presentation is the speech of acceptance. The speech of acceptance is a speech given by the recipient of a prize or honor. For example, in the above video clip from the 2009 MTV Music Video Awards, Taylor Swift starts by expressing her appreciation, gets interrupted by Kanye West, and ends by saying, &ldquo;I would like to thank the fans and MTV, thank you.&rdquo; While obviously not a traditional acceptance speech because of the interruption, she did manage to get in the important parts.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There are three typical components of a speech of acceptance: thank the givers of the award or honor, thank those who helped you achieve your goal, and put the award or honor into perspective. First, you want to thank the people who have given you the award or honor and possibly those who voted for you. We see this done every year during the Oscars, &ldquo;First, I&rsquo;d like to thank the academy and all the academy voters.&rdquo; Second, you want to give credit to those who helped you achieve the award or honor. No person accomplishes things in life on his or her own. We all have families and friends and colleagues who support us and help us achieve what we do in life, and a speech of acceptance is a great time to graciously recognize those individuals. Lastly, put the award in perspective. Tell the people listening to your speech why the award is meaningful to you.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speeches of Dedication</p>
            <p>The fourth ceremonial speech is the speech of dedication. A speech of dedication is delivered when a new store opens, a building is named after someone, a plaque is placed on a wall, a new library is completed, and so on. These speeches are designed to highlight the importance of the project and possibly those to whom the project has been dedicated. Maybe your great-uncle has died and left your college tons of money, so the college has decided to rename one of the dorms after your great-uncle. In this case, you may be asked to speak at the dedication.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When preparing the speech of dedication, start by explaining how you are involved in the dedication. If the person to whom the dedication is being made is a relative, tell the audience that the building is being named after your great-uncle who bestowed a gift to his alma mater. Second, you want to explain what is being dedicated. If the dedication is a new building or a preexisting building, you want to explain what is being dedicated and the importance of the structure. You should then explain who was involved in the project. If the project is a new structure, talk about the people who built the structure or designed it. If the project is a preexisting structure, talk about the people who put together and decided on the dedication. Lastly, explain why the structure is important for the community where it&rsquo;s located. If the dedication is for a new store, talk about how the store will bring in new jobs and new shopping opportunities. If the dedication is for a new wing of a hospital, talk about how patients will be served and the advances in medicine the new wing will provide the community.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Toasts</p>
            <p>At one time or another, almost everyone is going to be asked to deliver a toast. A toast is a speech designed to congratulate, appreciate, or remember. First, toasts can be delivered for the purpose of congratulating someone for an honor, a new job, or getting married. You can also toast someone to show your appreciation for something they&rsquo;ve done. Lastly, we toast people to remember them and what they have accomplished.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When preparing a toast, the first goal is always to keep your remarks brief. Toasts are generally given during the middle of some kind of festivities (e.g., wedding, retirement party, farewell party), and you don&rsquo;t want your toast to take away from those festivities for too long. Second, the goal of a toast is to focus attention on the person or persons being toasted&mdash;not on the speaker. As such, while you are speaking you need to focus your attention to the people being toasted, both by physically looking at them and by keeping your message about them. You should also avoid any inside jokes between you and the people being toasted because toasts are public and should be accessible for everyone who hears them. To conclude a toast, simply say something like, &ldquo;Please join me in recognizing Joan for her achievement&rdquo; and lift your glass. When you lift your glass, this will signal to others to do the same and then you can all take a drink, which is the end of your speech.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Roasts</p>
            <p>The roast speech is a very interesting and peculiar speech because it is designed to both praise and good-naturedly insult a person being honored. Generally, roasts are given at the conclusion of a banquet in honor of someone&rsquo;s life achievements. The television station Comedy Central has been conducting roasts of various celebrities for a few years.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s pick this short clip apart. You&rsquo;ll notice that the humor doesn&rsquo;t pull any punches. The goal of the roast is to both praise and insult in a good-natured manner. You&rsquo;ll also see that the roaster, in this case Stephen Colbert, is standing behind a lectern while the roastee, President George W. Bush, is clearly on display for the audience to see, and periodically you&rsquo;ll see the camera pan to President Bush to take in his reactions. Half the fun of a good roast is watching the roastee&rsquo;s reactions during the roast, so it&rsquo;s important to have the roastee clearly visible by the audience.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>How does one prepare for a roast? First, you want to really think about the person who is being roasted. Do they have any strange habits or amusing stories in their past that you can discuss? When you think through these things you want to make sure that you cross anything off your list that is truly private information or will really hurt the person. The goal of a roast is to poke at them, not massacre them. Second, when selecting which aspects to poke fun at, you need to make sure that the items you choose are widely known by your audience. Roasts work when the majority of people in the audience can relate to the jokes being made. If you have an inside joke with the roastee, bringing it up during roast may be great fun for the two of you, but it will leave your audience unimpressed. Lastly, end on a positive note. While the jokes are definitely the fun part of a roast, you should leave the roastee knowing that you truly do care about and appreciate the person.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Eulogies</p>
            <p>A eulogy is a speech given in honor of someone who has died. (Don&rsquo;t confuse &ldquo;eulogy&rdquo; with &ldquo;elegy,&rdquo; a poem or song of mourning.) Unless you are a minister, priest, rabbi, imam, or other form of religious leader, you&rsquo;ll probably not deliver too many eulogies in your lifetime. However, when the time comes to deliver a eulogy, it&rsquo;s good to know what you&rsquo;re doing and to adequately prepare your remarks.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In this eulogy, Senator Obama delivers the eulogy by recalling Rosa Parks importance and her legacy in American history.</p>
            <p>When preparing a eulogy, first you need to know as much information about the deceased as possible. The more information you have about the person, the more personal you can make the eulogy. While you can rely on your own information if you were close to the deceased, it is always a good idea to ask friends and relatives of the deceased for their memories, as these may add important facets that may not have occurred to you. Of course, if you were not very close to the deceased, you will need to ask friends and family for information. Second, although eulogies are delivered on the serious and sad occasion of a funeral or memorial service for the deceased, it is very helpful to look for at least one point to be lighter or humorous. In some cultures, in fact, the friends and family attending the funeral will expect the eulogy to be highly entertaining and amusing. While eulogies are not roasts, one goal of the humor or lighter aspects of a eulogy is to relieve the tension that is created by the serious nature of the occasion. Lastly, remember to tell the deceased&rsquo;s story. Tell the audience about who this person was and what the person stood for in life. The more personal you can make a eulogy, the more touching it will be for the deceased&rsquo;s friends and families. The eulogy should remind the audience to celebrate the person&rsquo;s life as well as mourn their death.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speeches of Farewell</p>
            <p>A speech of farewell allows someone to say good-bye to one part of his or her life as he or she is moving on to the next part of life. Maybe you&rsquo;ve accepted a new job and are leaving your current job, or you&rsquo;re graduating from college and entering the work force. Whatever the case may be, periods of transition are often marked by speeches of farewell.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When preparing a speech of farewell, the goal should be to thank the people in your current position and let them know how much you appreciate them as you make the move to your next position in life. In Derek Jeter&rsquo;s speech, he starts by talking about the history of the 1923 Yankee Stadium and then thanks the fans for their support. Second, you want to express to your audience how much the experience has meant to you. A farewell speech is a time to commemorate and think about the good times you&rsquo;ve had. As such, you should avoid negativity during this speech. Lastly, you want to make sure that you end on a high note. Derek Jeter concludes his speech by saying, &ldquo;On behalf of this entire organization, we just want to take this moment to salute you, the greatest fans in the world!&rdquo; at which point Jeter and the other players take off their ball caps and hold them up toward the audience.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Inspirational Speaking</p>
            <p>The goal of an inspirational speech is to elicit or arouse an emotional state within an audience. In Section 18.2.1 &ldquo;Ceremonial Speaking&rdquo;, we looked at ceremonial speeches. Although some inspirational speeches are sometimes tied to ceremonial occasions, there are also other speaking contexts that call for inspirational speeches. For our purposes, we are going to look at two types of inspirational speeches: goodwill and speeches of commencement.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speeches to Ensure Goodwill</p>
            <p>Goodwill is an intangible asset that is made up of the favor or reputation of an individual or organization. Speeches of goodwill are often given in an attempt to get audience members to view the person or organization more favorably. Although speeches of goodwill are clearly persuasive, they try not to be obvious about the persuasive intent and are often delivered as information-giving speeches that focus on an individual or organization&rsquo;s positives attributes. There are three basic types of speeches of goodwill: public relations, justification, and apology.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speeches for Public Relations</p>
            <p>In a public relations speech, the speaker is speaking to enhance one&rsquo;s own image or the image of his or her organization. You can almost think of these speeches as cheerleading speeches because the ultimate goal is to get people to like the speaker and what he or she represents.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Notice that he keeps emphasizing what his company is doing to fix the problem. Every part of this speech is orchestrated to make BP look caring and attempts to get some amount of goodwill from the viewing public.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speeches of Justification</p>
            <p>The second common speech of goodwill is the speech of justification, which is given when someone attempts to defend why certain actions were taken or will be taken. In these speeches, speakers have already enacted (or decided to enact) some kind of behavior, and are now attempting to justify why the behavior is or was appropriate.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speeches of Apology</p>
            <p>The final speech of goodwill is the speech of apology. Frankly, these speeches have become more and more commonplace. Every time we turn around, a politician, professional athlete, musician, or actor/actress is doing something reprehensible and getting caught. In fact, the speech of apology has quickly become a fodder for humor as well</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When you need to make an apology speech, there are three elements that you need to include: be honest and take responsibility, say you&rsquo;re sorry, and offer restitution. First, a speaker needs to be honest and admit to doing something wrong. The worst apology speeches are those in which the individual tries to sidestep the wrongdoing. Even if you didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, it is often best to take responsibility from a public perception perspective. Second, say that you are sorry. People need to know that you are remorseful for what you&rsquo;ve done. One of the problems many experts saw with Tiger Woods&rsquo;s speech is that he doesn&rsquo;t look remorseful at all. While the words coming out of his mouth are appropriate, he looks like a robot forced to read from a manuscript written by his press agent. Lastly, you need to offer restitution. Restitution can come in the form of fixing something broken or a promise not to engage in such behavior in the future. People in society are very willing to forgive and forget when they are asked.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Speeches for Commencements</p>
            <p>The second type of inspirational speech is the speech of commencement, which is designed to recognize and celebrate the achievements of a graduating class or other group of people. The most typical form of commencement speech happens when someone graduates from school. Nearly all of us have sat through commencement speeches at some point in our lives. And if you&rsquo;re like us, you&rsquo;ve heard good ones and bad ones.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re ever asked to deliver a commencement speech, there are some key points to think through when deciding on your speech&rsquo;s content.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If there is a specific theme for the graduation, make sure that your commencement speech addresses that theme. If there is no specific theme, come up with one for your speech. Some common commencement speech themes are commitment, competitiveness, competence, confidence, decision making, discipline, ethics, failure (and overcoming failure), faith, generosity, integrity, involvement, leadership, learning, persistence, personal improvement, professionalism, reality, responsibility, and self-respect.</p>
            <p>Talk about your life and how graduates can learn from your experiences to avoid pitfalls or take advantages of life. How can your life inspire the graduates in their future endeavors?</p>
            <p>Make the speech humorous. Commencement speeches should be entertaining and make an audience laugh.</p>
            <p>Be brief! Nothing is more painful than a commencement speaker who drones on and on. Remember, the graduates are there to get their diplomas; their families are there to watch the graduates walk across the stage.</p>
            <p>Remember, while you may be the speaker, you&rsquo;ve been asked to impart wisdom and advice for the people graduating and moving on with their lives, so keep it focused on them. Place the commencement speech into the broader context of the graduates&rsquo; lives. Show the graduates how the advice and wisdom you are offering can be utilized to make their own lives better.</p>
