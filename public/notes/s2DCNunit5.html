        <h2>What Is Ethernet?</h2>
        <p>Ethernet is a networking technology that includes the protocol, port, cable, and computer chip needed to plug a desktop or laptop into a local area network (LAN) for speedy data transmission via coaxial or fiber optic cables.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Ethernet is a communication technology developed in the 1970s by Xerox that links computers in a network via a wired connection. It connects<a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/networking/articles/wide-area-network-vs-local-area-network-differences-and-similarities/"><u>&nbsp;local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN)&nbsp;</u></a>systems (WAN). With LAN and WAN, several devices, such as printers and laptops, may be connected across buildings, residences, and even small communities.</p>
        <p>It provides a straightforward user interface that facilitates the connection of several devices, including switches, routers, and PCs. With a router and just a few Ethernet connections, it is possible to construct a<a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/networking/articles/what-is-local-area-network/"><u>&nbsp;local area network (LAN</u></a>)&nbsp;that enables users to communicate between all connected devices. This is because laptops have Ethernet connectors, into which cables are inserted, and the other end is linked to routers.</p>
        <p>Most Ethernet devices are compatible with Ethernet connections and devices that run at slower speeds. However, the connection speed will be determined by the weakest components.</p>
        <p>Wireless networks have superseded Ethernet in many locations, yet the latter continues to be more prevalent for wired networking. Wired networks are more reliable and less susceptible to interference than wireless networks. This is the primary reason why so many businesses and organizations continue to adopt Ethernet.</p>
        <p>Ethernet celebrated 25 years of existence in 1998; by that time, it had undergone several revisions as technology advanced. Ethernet is continually redesigned as its capabilities expand and evolve. Today, it is among the most widely used network technologies worldwide.</p>
        <h3><strong>How did Ethernet evolve?</strong></h3>
        <p>Ethernet was created in the early 1970s at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) by a group that included David Boggs and Robert Metcalfe. In 1983, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) ratified it as a standard.</p>
        <p>Metcalfe developed the idea of Ethernet in a document he wrote for Xerox PARC in 1973, marking the beginning of Ethernet&rsquo;s development. Metcalfe built Ethernet based on the Aloha system, an earlier networking initiative that started in 1968 at the University of Hawaii. Metcalfe determined in 1973 that the technology had surpassed its initial appellation, Alto Aloha Network, and rebranded it as Ethernet.</p>
        <p>Metcalfe and Boggs, together with their colleagues at Xerox, Charles Thacker, and Butler Lampson, would successfully trademark Ethernet technology four years later.</p>
        <p>In 1980, Xerox collaborated with Digital Equipment Corporation and Intel to create the first 10 Mbps Ethernet standard. And in the meantime, the IEEE Local and Metropolitan Area Networks (LAN/MAN) Standards Committee set out to produce an equivalent open standard. The LAN/MAN committee established an Ethernet subcommittee with the designation 802.3. The IEEE adopted the first 802.3 standards for thick Ethernet in 1983 and was published formally in 1985.</p>
        <h3><strong>How does Ethernet work?</strong></h3>
        <p>The Ethernet protocol employs a star topology or linear bus, which is the basis for the IEEE 802.3 standard. In the OSI network structure, this protocol works bot.h the physical layer and data link layer, the first two levels. Ethernet divides the data connection layer into two distinct layers: the logical link control tier and also the medium access control (MAC) tier.</p>
        <p>The data connection layer in a network system is primarily concerned with transmitting data packets from one node to the other. Ethernet employs an access mechanism known as CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection) to enable each computer to listen to the connection before delivering data across the network.</p>
        <p>Ethernet also transmits data using two components: packets and frames. The frame contains the sent data payload as well as the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Both the MAC and physical addresses of the sender and recipient</li>
          <li>Error correction data for identifying transmission faults</li>
          <li>Information on Virtual LAN (VLAN) tagging, as well as the<a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/iot/articles/what-is-qos/"><u>quality of service (QoS)</u></a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each frame is encapsulated in packets that comprise many bytes of data to set up the connection and identify the frame&rsquo;s commencement point.</p>

        <h3><strong>Key components of an Ethernet connection</strong></h3>
        <p>An Ethernet connection encompasses the following:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Ethernet protocol</strong>: This protocol was developed in the 1970s by Xerox. It is a series of standards that governs how data is sent between Ethernet components as explained before.</li>
          <li><strong>The Ethernet port</strong>: Ethernet ports (commonly known as jacks or sockets) are openings on computer network infrastructure into which one may plug in Ethernet cables. It supports cables with RJ-45 connectors. The Ethernet connector on the majority of computers serves to connect the equipment to a wired connection. The Ethernet port of a computer is linked to an Ethernet network adapter, also known as an Ethernet card, mounted on the motherboard. A router may contain numerous Ethernet ports to support various wired network devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Ethernet network adapter</strong>: An Ethernet adapter is a chip or card that fits into a slot on the motherboard and allows a computer to connect to a local area network (LAN). In the past, these were always used with desktop computers. Ethernet is now integrated into the chipsets of laptop and desktop motherboards.</li>
          <li><strong>An Ethernet cable</strong>: Ethernet cable, often known as a network cable, links your computer to a modem, router, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/networking/articles/what-is-network-switch/"><u>network switch.</u></a>The Ethernet cable consists of the RJ45 connection, the internal cabling, and a plastic jacket.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key types of Ethernet connectivity are as follows:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Ethernet Connections</strong></p>
        <h3><strong>1. Ethernet connections that use coaxial cables</strong></h3>
        <p>A coaxial cable transmits electrical signals at high frequencies with minimal loss. Ethernet types 10Base2 and 10Base5 are now used. A copper conductor is surrounded by a dielectric insulator often constructed of PVC or Teflon. The dielectric insulator is encircled by a braided conductive metallic shield that minimizes electromagnetic interference of the metal as well as outside interference. Lastly, the metallic shield is covered with a PVC, or other fire-resistant plastic wrapping called a sheath. 10 Mbps is its highest transmission speed.</p>
        <p>This Ethernet type can be further classified into networks that use one of the following cable types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tri-axial</strong>: Using an extra copper braid shield, this variant of Ethernet offers additional bandwidth and interference resistance. It is often used to link cameras and cable televisions.</li>
          <li><strong>RG-6</strong>: This kind of coaxial cable can be used when signal quality needs improvement. They include a thicker dielectric insulator and are employed in wireless broadband, cable television, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Hardline</strong>: This cable variant is utilized in Ethernet networks that demand a strong signal. They are employed in telephone and internet connections.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>2. Connections via fiber optic cables</strong></h3>
        <p>These connections employ optical fibers with glass cores wrapped by several sheets of cladding material, often PVC or Teflon. Since it sends data as light signals, there are no interference difficulties with fiber optics.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/networking/articles/5g-vs-fiber-optics-which-one-suits-iot-connectivity-the-best/"><u>Fiber optics</u></a>&nbsp;can transfer signals over far greater distances than twist pairs and coaxial cables. It employs 10BaseF, 100BaseFX, 100BaseBX, 100BaseSX, 1000BaseFx, 1000BaseSX, and 1000BaseBx variations of Ethernet. Consequently, it can transmit information at a rapid speed. This Ethernet type may also be subdivided into networks using the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Single-mode fiber (SMF)</strong>: It is utilized for long-distance communication and employs a single beam of light to deliver data.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-mode fiber (MMF)</strong>: It utilizes numerous light beams to convey data and is less expensive than other alternatives.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
        <h3><strong>3. Ethernet connections via twisted pair cables</strong></h3>
        <p>Twisted pair is a copper wire cable consisting of two insulated copper wires wrapped around to prevent interference and crosstalk. It employs 10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, and a few additional Ethernet variants of more recent origin. It utilizes RJ-45 plugs. This Ethernet type may be among the following variations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ethernets that use shielded twisted pair (STP) cables</strong>: This foil shield offers protection against interference flowing into or out of the cable. Consequently, they are used across more considerable distances and at higher transmission rates.</li>
          <li><strong>Ethernets that use unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables</strong>: Unshielded twisted pair cable is now one of the most frequently deployed cables in computer networks. UTP comprises two twisted, insulated copper wires; twisting cables help limit interference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>4. Fast Ethernet</strong></h3>
        <p>It is an Ethernet network capable of 100 Mbit/s data transmission. It may use twisted pairs or fiber optic cables. (The earlier 10 Mbit/s Ethernet is still deployed and utilized but lacks the bandwidth required for specific network video scenarios.)</p>
        <p>Most network-connected devices, like laptops and network cameras, include a 100BASE-TX/10BASE-T Ethernet interface, often referred to as a 10/100 interface, that supports both 10 Mbit/s and Fast Ethernet. Cat-5 cable is the type of twisted pair cable which enables Fast Ethernet.</p>
        <h3><strong>5. Gigabit Ethernet</strong></h3>
        <p>Gigabit Ethernet, which might alternatively be based on twisted pair or fiber optic cable, provides a data transfer rate of one gigabit per second (1 Gbit/s) and is gaining in popularity. It is anticipated to supersede Fast Ethernet as the de facto norm in the near future.</p>
        <h2>Token Ring</h2>
        <p>Token ring (IEEE 802.5) is a communication protocol in a local area network (LAN) where all stations are connected in a ring topology and pass one or more tokens for channel acquisition. A token is a special frame of 3 bytes that circulates along the ring of stations. A station can send data frames only if it holds a token. The tokens are released on successful receipt of the data frame.</p>
        <h3><strong>Token Passing Mechanism in Token Ring</strong></h3>
        <p>If a station has a frame to transmit when it receives a token, it sends the frame and then passes the token to the next station; otherwise it simply passes the token to the next station. Passing the token means receiving the token from the preceding station and transmitting to the successor station. The data flow is unidirectional in the direction of the token passing. In order that tokens are not circulated infinitely, they are removed from the network once their purpose is completed. This is shown in the following diagram &minus;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Token Bus</h2>
        <p>Token Bus (IEEE 802.4) is a standard for implementing token ring over virtual ring in LANs. The physical media has a bus or a tree topology and uses coaxial cables. A virtual ring is created with the nodes/stations and the token is passed from one node to the next in a sequence along this virtual ring. Each node knows the address of its preceding station and its succeeding station. A station can only transmit data when it has the token. The working principle of token bus is similar to Token Ring.</p>
        <h3><strong>Token Passing Mechanism in Token Bus</strong></h3>
        <p>A token is a small message that circulates among the stations of a computer network providing permission to the stations for transmission. If a station has data to transmit when it receives a token, it sends the data and then passes the token to the next station; otherwise, it simply passes the token to the next station. This is depicted in the following diagram &minus;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h1><strong>IEEE 802.6 (DQDB)</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Background of IEEE 802.6 (DQDB)</h2>
        <p>IEEE 802.6, or Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB), is a metropolitan area network (MAN) technology for LANs developed by the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers' Committee for Computer Communications Standards. It is designed for use in metropolitan areas with wide geographical coverage, such as cities, campuses, and other places where the users are linked together over distances up to 10 kilometers apart. The fundamental idea behind DQDB is to build numerous virtual buses that can be utilised for two endpoints on a network to communicate in both directions. Each bus has its own unique address for identification and allows for reservation-based access for data transmission across different nodes in the network.</p>
        <h2>Features, specifications, applications and aspects of IEEE 802.6 (DQDB)</h2>
        <p>IEEE 802.6 (Distributed Queue Dual Bus) is a standard for metropolitan area networks (MANs) that was developed by the IEEE. This standard provides a high-speed, reliable, and efficient communication system for MANs. In this article, the features, specifications, applications, and aspects of IEEE 802.6 (DQDB) will be discussed.</p>
        <h3><strong>Features of IEEE 802.6 (DQDB)</strong></h3>
        <p>IEEE 802.6 (DQDB) has several features that make it an ideal communication system for MANs. These features include &minus;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Distributed Queuing</strong>&minus; IEEE 802.6 (DQDB) uses a distributed queuing algorithm that ensures fair access to the network by all users. This algorithm also provides a low latency, which is essential for real-time applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Dual Bus Architecture</strong>&minus; IEEE 802.6 (DQDB) uses a dual-bus architecture that provides redundancy and fault tolerance. If one bus fails, the other bus takes over, ensuring continuous communication.</li>
          <li><strong>Token Passing Mechanism</strong>&minus; IEEE 802.6 (DQDB) uses a token passing mechanism to control access to the network. This mechanism ensures that only one station can transmit data at a time, preventing collisions and ensuring efficient use of the network.</li>

        <h1>Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS)</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) is a public,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/packet"><u>packet</u></a>-switched service aimed at enterprises that need to exchange large amounts of data with other enterprises over a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/WAN-wide-area-network"><u>wide area network</u></a>&nbsp;on a nonconstant or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/burstiness"><u>bursty</u></a>&nbsp;basis.</p>
        <p>It extends the performance and efficiency of the company's local area network (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/local-area-network-LAN"><u>LAN</u></a>) over a wide area on a switched, as-needed basis. For this kind of data exchange, SMDS provides an architecture, as well as a set of services.</p>
        <p>SMDS is designed for moderate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/bandwidth"><u>bandwidth</u></a>&nbsp;connections -- 1-34&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/Mbps"><u>megabits per second</u></a>. This makes it perfectly suitable and affordable for LANs with such requirements.</p>
        <p>Prior to 1995, the only way to connect LANs was through a dedicated, expensive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchunifiedcommunications/definition/leased-line"><u>private line</u></a>. SMDS makes it possible to connect LANs more economically and, in many cases, more flexibly. SMDS can also be extended to support higher- and lower-bandwidth connections.</p>
        <h3>How does SMDS work?</h3>
        <p>Different types of devices can connect to a SMDS service, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/bridge"><u>bridges</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/router"><u>routers</u></a>&nbsp;and Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/CSU-DSU"><u>CSU/DSU</u></a>) hardware. SMDS is generally delivered over a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/SDH"><u>Synchronous Digital Hierarchy</u></a>&nbsp;ring or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/Synchronous-Optical-Network"><u>Synchronous Optical Network</u></a>&nbsp;ring. It has a maximum effective serving radius of approximately 30 miles (48 kilometers).</p>
        <p>A LAN typically connects to SMDS through a router using an RS-449 interface and a CSU/DSU. For low-speed access, it uses a copper Digital Signal 1 connection, and for high transmission speeds, it uses a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/fiber-optics-optical-fiber"><u>fiber</u></a>&nbsp;Digital Signal 3 connection.</p>
        <p>The connection between the LAN and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/telecommunications-telecom"><u>telecom</u></a>&nbsp;provider's central office is Subscriber Network Interface (SNI). From here, the central office provides a&nbsp;<a href="https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/gateway"><u>gateway</u></a>&nbsp;to the SMDS packet-switching network.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1>Message switching techniques</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Switched communication networks are those in which data transferred from source to destination is routed between various intermediate nodes. Switching is the technique by which nodes control or switch data to transmit it between specific points on a network. There are 3 common switching techniques:&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Circuit Switching</li>
          <li>Packet Switching</li>
          <li>Message Switching</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Message Switching &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Message switching was a technique developed as an alternative to circuit switching before packet switching was introduced. In message switching, end-users communicate by sending and receiving&nbsp;<em>messages</em>&nbsp;that included the entire data to be shared. Messages are the smallest individual unit.&nbsp;<br />Also, the sender and receiver are not directly connected. There are a number of intermediate nodes that transfer data and ensure that the message reaches its destination. Message switched data networks are hence called hop-by-hop systems.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They provide 2 distinct and important characteristics:&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Store and forward &ndash;</strong>The intermediate nodes have the responsibility of transferring the entire message to the next node. Hence, each node must have storage capacity. A message will only be delivered if the next hop and the link connecting it are both available, otherwise, it&rsquo;ll be stored indefinitely. A store-and-forward switch forwards a message only if sufficient resources are available and the next hop is accepting data. This is called the store-and-forward property.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Message delivery &ndash;</strong>This implies wrapping the entire information in a single message and transferring it from the source to the destination node. Each message must have a header that contains the message routing information, including the source and destination.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Message switching network consists of transmission links (channels), store-and-forward switch nodes, and end stations as shown in the following picture:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics of message switching &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Message switching is advantageous as it enables efficient usage of network resources. Also, because of the store-and-forward capability of intermediary nodes, traffic can be efficiently regulated and controlled. Message delivery as one unit, rather than in pieces, is another benefit.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However, message switching has certain disadvantages as well. Since messages are stored indefinitely at each intermediate node, switches require a large storage capacity. Also, these are pretty slow. This is because at each node, first there is a wait till the entire message is received, then it must be stored and transmitted after processing the next node and links to it depending on availability and channel traffic. Hence, message switching cannot be used for real-time or interactive applications like a video conference.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages of Message Switching &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Message switching has the following advantages:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>As message switching is able to store the message for which communication channel is not available, it helps in reducing the traffic congestion in the network.</li>
          <li>In message switching, the data channels are shared by the network devices.</li>
          <li>It makes traffic management efficient by assigning priorities to the messages.</li>
          <li>Because the messages are delivered via a store and forward method, it is possible to include priority in them.</li>
          <li>It allows for infinite message lengths.</li>
          <li>Unlike circuit switching, it does not necessitate the actual connection of source and destination devices.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of Message Switching &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Message switching has the following disadvantages:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Message switching cannot be used for real-time applications as storing messages causes delay.</li>
          <li>In message switching, the message has to be stored for which every intermediate device in the network requires a large storing capacity.</li>
          <li>Because the system is so intricate, people are frequently unaware of whether or not messages are correctly conveyed. This could cause problems in social relationships.</li>
          <li>The type of message switching does not create a dedicated path between the devices. It is not dependable communication because there is no direct relationship between sender and receiver.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Applications &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />The store-and-forward method was implemented in telegraph message switching centres. Today, although many major networks and systems are packet-switched or circuit-switched networks, their delivery processes can be based on message switching. For example, in most electronic mail systems the delivery process is based on message switching, while the network is in fact either circuit-switched or packet-switched.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These are a set of communication standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network. Before&nbsp;<em>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)</em>, the telephone system was seen as a way to transmit voice, with some special services available for data. The main feature of ISDN is that it can integrate speech and data on the same lines, which were not available in the classic telephone system.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>ISDN is a circuit-switched telephone network system, but it also provides access to packet-switched networks that allows digital transmission of voice and data. This results in potentially better voice or data quality than an analog phone can provide. It provides a packet-switched connection for data in increments of 64 kilobit/s. It provided a maximum of 128 kbit/s bandwidth in both upstream and downstream directions. A greater data rate was achieved through channel bonding. Generally, ISDN B-channels of three or four BRIs (six to eight 64 kbit/s channels) are bonded.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the context of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-osi-model/"><u>OSI model</u></a>, ISDN is employed as the network in data-link and physical layers but commonly ISDN is often limited to usage to Q.931 and related protocols. These protocols introduced in 1986 are a set of signaling protocols establishing and breaking circuit-switched connections, and for advanced calling features for the user. ISDN provides simultaneous voice, video, and text transmission between individual desktop videoconferencing systems and group videoconferencing systems.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>ISDN Interfaces:</strong>&nbsp;<br />The following are the interfaces of ISDN:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Basic Rate Interface (BRI) &ndash;</strong><br />There are two data-bearing channels (&lsquo;B&rsquo; channels) and one signaling channel (&lsquo;D&rsquo; channel) in BRI to initiate connections. The B channels operate at a maximum of 64 Kbps while the D channel operates at a maximum of 16 Kbps. The two channels are independent of each other. For example, one channel is used as a TCP/IP connection to a location while the other channel is used to send a fax to a remote location. In iSeries ISDN supports a basic rate interface (BRl).&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The basic rate interface (BRl) specifies a digital pipe consisting of two B channels of 64 Kbps each and one D channel of 16 Kbps. This equals a speed of 144 Kbps. In addition, the BRl service itself requires an operating overhead of 48 Kbps. Therefore a digital pipe of 192 Kbps is required.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong>Primary Rate Interface (PRI) &ndash;</strong><br />Primary Rate Interface service consists of a D channel and either 23 or 30 B channels depending on the country you are in. PRI is not supported on the iSeries. A digital pipe with 23 B channels and one 64 Kbps D channel is present in the usual Primary Rate Interface (PRI). Twenty-three B channels of 64 Kbps each and one D channel of 64 Kbps equals 1.536 Mbps. The PRI service uses 8 Kbps of overhead also. Therefore PRI requires a digital pipe of 1.544 Mbps.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><strong>Broadband-ISDN (B-ISDN) &ndash;</strong><br />Narrowband ISDN has been designed to operate over the current communications infrastructure, which is heavily dependent on the copper cable however B-ISDN relies mainly on the evolution of fiber optics. According to CCITT B-ISDN is best described as &lsquo;a service requiring transmission channels capable of supporting rates greater than the primary rate.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>ISDN Services:</strong>&nbsp;<br />ISDN provides a fully integrated digital service to users. These services fall into 3 categories- bearer services, teleservices, and supplementary services.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Bearer Services &ndash;</strong><br />Transfer of information (voice, data, and video) between users without the network manipulating the content of that information is provided by the bearer network. There is no need for the network to process the information and therefore does not change the content. Bearer services belong to the first three layers of the OSI model. They are well defined in the ISDN standard. They can be provided using circuit-switched, packet-switched, frame-switched, or cell-switched networks.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong>Teleservices &ndash;</strong><br />In this, the network may change or process the contents of the data. These services correspond to layers 4-7 of the OSI model. Teleservices rely on the facilities of the bearer services and are designed to accommodate complex user needs. The user need not be aware of the details of the process. Teleservices include telephony, teletex, telefax, videotex, telex, and teleconferencing. Though the ISDN defines these services by name yet they have not yet become standards.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><strong>Supplementary Service &ndash;</strong><br />Additional functionality to the bearer services and teleservices are provided by supplementary services. Reverse charging, call waiting, and message handling are examples of supplementary services which are all familiar with today&rsquo;s telephone company services.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Principle of ISDN:</strong>&nbsp;<br />The ISDN works based on the standards defined by ITU-T (formerly CCITT). The Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) coordinates standards for telecommunications on behalf of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and is based in Geneva, Switzerland. The various principles of ISDN as per ITU-T recommendation are:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To support switched and non-switched applications&nbsp;</li>
          <li>To support voice and non-voice applications&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Reliance on 64-kbps connections&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Intelligence in the network&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Layered protocol architecture&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Variety of configurations&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advantages of ISDN:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>ISDN channels have a reliable connection.</li>
          <li>ISDN is used to facilitate the user with multiple digital channels.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>It has faster data transfer rate.</li>
          <li>Efficient use of bandwidth</li>
          <li>Improved call quality</li>
          <li>Greater flexibility</li>
          <li>Integrated services</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages of ISDN:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>ISDN lines costlier than the other telephone system.</li>
          <li>It requires specialized digital devices.</li>
          <li>It is less flexible.</li>
          <li>Limited coverage</li>
          <li>High installation and maintenance costs</li>
          <li>Obsolescence</li>
          <li>Limited features</li>
