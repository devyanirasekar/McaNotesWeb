        <p><strong>Leadership:</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Definition and meaning:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Leadership is an integral and important part of management and plays a very vital role in managerial process.</p>
        <p>Leadership is the ability to build up confidence and zeal among people and to create an urge in them to be led. Leadership is the practice of influence that stimulates subordinates or followers to do their best towards the achievement of desired goals.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Definition</strong>:&nbsp;&ldquo;Leadership is a ability to influence a group of people so that they strive willingly and enthusiastically towards the achievement of goals.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Leadership is an art whereby an individual influences a group of individuals for achieving a common set of goals. To expand it further, leadership is a process of inter-personal relationships through which a person attempts to influence the behaviour of others for attainment of pre-determined objectives.</p>
        <h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
        <h3><strong>Characteristics of Leadership:</strong></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4><strong>1. Leadership is a process of Influence:</strong></h4>
        <p>Influence is the ability of an individual to change the behaviour, attitude, and belief of another individual directly or indirectly. Someone has rightly defined leaderships as the &ldquo;process of social influence in which one person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task&rdquo;.</p>
        <h4><strong>2. Leadership is not one-dimensional:</strong></h4>
        <p>The Essence of leadership is Followership. Leadership is a systems thinking in multiple dimensions. In terms of systems thinking, the organizational performers (followers) are must in the leadership process. Without followers there can be no leadership.</p>
        <h4><strong>3. Leadership is Multi-faceted:</strong></h4>
        <p>Leadership is a combination of personality and tangible skills (drive, integrity, self-confidence, attractive personality, decisiveness, etc), styles (Authoritarian to laissez-faire), and situational factors (organisation&rsquo;s internal and external environment, objectives, tasks, resources, and cultural values of leaders and the followers).</p>
        <h4><strong>4. Leadership is Goal oriented:</strong></h4>
        <p>Leadership is &ldquo;organizing a group of people to achieve a common goal.&rdquo; Thus, the influence concerns the goals only. Outside the goals, the concerns are not related to leadership.</p>
        <h4><strong>5. Leadership is not primarily a Particular Personality Trait:</strong></h4>
        <p>A trait closely linked to leadership is charisma, but many people who have charisma (for example, movie actors and sports heroes) are not leaders.</p>
        <h4><strong>6. Leadership is not primarily a Formal Position:</strong></h4>
        <p>There have been many great leaders who did not hold high positions&mdash;for example, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and&mdash;and Anna Hazare . On the other hand there are people who hold high positions but are not leaders.</p>
        <h4><strong>7. Leadership is not primarily a Set of Important Objectives:</strong></h4>
        <p>It involves getting things done.</p>
        <h4><strong>8. Leadership is not primarily a Set of Behaviours:</strong></h4>
        <p>Many leadership manuals suggest that leadership involves doing things such as delegating and providing inspiration and vision; but people who are not leaders can do these things, and some effective leaders don&rsquo;t do them at all.</p>
        <h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
        <h3><strong>Importance of Leadership:</strong></h3>
        <p>If an organization is flourishing, its members developing, and achieving breakthrough after breakthrough, then one can be sure about one thing that there is a strong leader at the helm of the organization. If an organization is failing, the problem again relates to the leader of the organization. Thus everything rises and falls on leadership.</p>
        <h4><strong>1. Guides and Inspires Subordinates:</strong></h4>
        <p>A leader has to not only supervise but also to play a guiding role for the subordinates. Guidance here means instructing the subordinates the way they have to perform their work effectively and efficiently. Leadership creates among subordinates a sense of belongingness and commitment. Desire for achievement is transformed into a passion.</p>
        <h4><strong>2. Secures Cooperation:</strong></h4>
        <p>A leader sells rather than tells. He persuades, rather than dictates, and creates enthusiasm among his subordinates and thus, secures their cooperation.</p>
        <h4><strong>3. Creates Confidence:</strong></h4>
        <p>Confidence is an important factor which can be achieved through expressing the work efforts to the subordinates, explaining them clearly their role and giving them guidelines to achieve the goals effectively. It is also important to hear the employees with regards to their complaints and problems.</p>
        <h4><strong>4. Builds Work Environment:</strong></h4>
        <p>Management is getting things done from people. An efficient work environment helps in sound and stable growth. Therefore, human relations should be kept into mind by a leader. He should have personal contacts with employees and should listen to their problems and solve them. He should treat employees on humanitarian terms.</p>
        <h4><strong>5. Maintains Discipline:</strong></h4>
        <p>By turning subordinates into followers, the job of securing order and compliance, becomes easy. He motivates the employees with economic and non- economic rewards and thereby gets the work from the subordinates voluntarily. It is this willingness on the part of subordinates which leads to maintenance of discipline.</p>
        <h4><strong>6. Facilitates Integration of Organisational and Personal Goals:</strong></h4>
        <p>A leader is one who is visionary, deciding the destination to be reached. Vision is the source of organisational objectives. Vision requires synchronisation of goals through integration of personal and organisational goals.</p>
        <p>A leader creates common goals and understanding among subordinates that their personal goals are related with the attainment of organisational goals. It also leads to coordination.</p>
        <h4><strong>7. Works as a Change Agent:</strong></h4>
        <p>No change in thinking, processes, and practices becomes possible without leadership. It is the leader who convinces actively about the change and making it part and parcel of their working and reducing resistance to change.</p>
        <h4><strong>8. Boosts Morale:</strong></h4>
        <p>Morale denotes willing co-operation of the employees towards their work and getting them into confidence and winning their trust. A leader can be a morale booster by achieving full co-operation so that they perform with best of their abilities as they work to achieve goals.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Leadership</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Autocratic or Authoritarian leadership</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>An autocratic leader centralizes power and decision-making in himself. He gives orders, assigns tasks and duties without consulting the employees. The leader takes full authority and assumes full responsibility.</p>
        <p>Autocratic leadership is negative, based on threats and punishment. Subordinates act as he directs. He neither cares for their opinions nor permits them to influence the decision. He believes that because of his authority he alone can decide what is best in a given situation.</p>
        <p>Autocratic leadership is based upon close supervision, clear-cut direction and commanding order of the superior. It facilitates quick decisions, prompt action and unity of direction. It depends on a lesser degree of delegation. But too much use of authority might result in strikes and industrial disputes. It is likely to produce frustration and retard the growth of the capacity of employees.</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong> Democratic or Participative leadership</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Participative or democratic leaders decentralise authority. It is characterised by consultation with the subordinates and their participation in the formulation of plans and policies. He encourages participation in decision-making.</p>
        <p>He leads the subordinates mainly through persuasion and example rather than fear and force. Sometimes the leader serves as a moderator of the ideas and suggestions from his group. McGregor labels this style as Theory Y.</p>
        <p>Taylor&rsquo;s scientific management was based on the inability of the ordinary employees to make effective decisions about their work. Hence the decision-making power was vested with the management. But recent studies indicate the need for participation by subordinates. The modern trend favours sharing the responsibility with the employees.</p>
        <p>This will foster enthusiasm in them. The employees feel that management is interested in them as well as in their ideas and suggestions. They will, therefore, place their suggestions for improvement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Advantages for democratic leadership are as follows: (i) higher motivation and improved morale; (ii) increased co-operation with the management; (iii) improved job performance; (iv) reduction of grievances and (v) reduction of absenteeism and employee turnover.</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><strong> The Laissez-faire or Free-rein leadership</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Free-rein leaders avoid power and responsibility. The laissez-faire or non-interfering type of leader passes on the responsibility for decision-making to his subordinates and takes a minimum of initiative in administration. He gives no direction and allows the group to establish its own goals and work out its own problems.</p>
        <p>The leader plays only a minor role. His idea is that each member of the group when left to himself will put forth his best effort and the maximum results can be achieved in this way. The leader acts as an umpire. But as no direction or control is exercised over the people, the organisation is likely to flounder.</p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li><strong> Paternalistic leadership</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Under this management style the leader assumes that his function is fatherly or paternal. Paternalism means papa knows best. The relationship between the leader and his group is the same as the relationship between the head of the family and the members of the family. The leader guides and protects his subordinates as members of his family.</p>
        <p>As the head of the family he provides his subordinates with good working conditions and fringe benefits. It is assumed that workers will work harder out of gratitude. This leadership style was admirably successful in Japan with her peculiar social background.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Team Building:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Group discussion</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Group discussion is when a group of people comes together to discuss a certain topic. Many Recruiters use group discussion (GD) to test a candidate&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-communication-skills/"><u>communication skills</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/ways-to-build-your-leadership-skills/"><u>leadership skills</u></a>, test topic knowledge, etc.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Group Discussion is generally the next level after the entrance exam to pursue a professional degree. In the case of recruitments, Group Discussion can be the starting or at the end, depending on different companies or organizations.</p>
        <h2><strong>Importance of Group Discussion</strong></h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Increases confidence</strong><strong><br /></strong>The GD allows the participants to speak in public, which increases their confidence to speak without any hesitation.</li>
          <li><strong>Focuses on Deep thinking</strong><strong><br /></strong>It tests the knowledge of a candidate. The participants get only a few minutes (3 to 5) for the preparation. In such a small duration, they have to make a list of points to speak. The participants in a group listen and understand other participants points of view, making them think deeply about the topic.</li>
          <li><strong>Improves Communication Skills</strong><strong><br /></strong>GD helps the students to represent their views and ask the questions. It not only increases the confidence of a candidate but also enhances their communication skills.</li>
          <li><strong>Removes hesitation of speaking</strong><strong><br /></strong>Some candidates usually have hesitation in speaking in public. At starting, such candidates might face difficulty while speaking. But, after two or three Group Discussion, it improves. Group Discussion helps such candidates to speak loudly and express their views on the topic. It further removes their hesitation in speaking.</li>
          <li><strong>Team Work</strong><strong><br /></strong>Group Discussion is also based on teamwork. In a company, it is very important to work as a team for the assigned project. Due to this, the quality of working together with team members is checked in the Group Discussion. The panelist also judges the cooperation of participants in the group. It allows participants to share their views with other participants in the group.</li>
          <li><strong>Behavior</strong><strong><br /></strong>It helps to understand the attitude and behavior of the candidates towards other participants in a group.</li>
          <li><strong>Listening Skills</strong><strong><br /></strong>GD improves the listening skills of the candidates. For example, the panelist may ask any candidate in a group to summarize the discussion. Acandidate can only summarize if he/she has good listening skills. Due to this, every candidate presents in the discussion listens carefully. It further improves the listening skills of the candidates.</li>
          <li><strong>Diversity in the Ideas</strong><strong><br /></strong>The Group Discussion involves sharing ideas with other participants in the group. Every participant shares his/her thoughts in the group, which makes the diversities in the ideas.</li>
          <li><strong>Recruitments</strong><strong><br /></strong>Group Discussion is widely used for the recruitment process. It helps panelist to select a few candidates from the group. It also helps them to judge that the candidate is suitable for the organization or not.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Which skills are evaluated in group discussion?</strong></h2>
        <p>In a group discussion, the panellists evaluate the following skills to check the performance of a candidate:</p>
        <h3><strong>Subject knowledge</strong></h3>
        <p>The first thing that employers test is your expertise in the role's subject area. For example, if you apply for a sales position, the employers expect you to have in-depth knowledge of their products and sales process.</p>
        <h3><strong>Creativity/Originality</strong></h3>
        <p>Some jobs require innovative ideas and out-of-the-box solutions. In such cases, the panellists may employ group activities to check your creativity and originality of ideas in a group.</p>
        <h3><strong>Voice</strong></h3>
        <p>Communication skills include tone, volume and pitch control and your style of delivery. This skill is essential in customer-facing roles and in regular interaction with your peers and seniors. Employers check for an assertive approach, authoritative voice, clarity in speech and audible tone in a typical group discussion.</p>
        <h3><strong>Body language</strong></h3>
        <p>In a workplace, your body language speaks volumes about your actions and temperament. So, during a group discussion, panellists judge your hand gestures and head movements along with the expressions on your face. They also give high ratings for a professional outlook and a confident, straight posture.</p>
        <h3><strong>Fluency</strong></h3>
        <p>Fluency in speech is a critical skill for sales jobs or customer service roles. Speaking with effective pauses without stuttering or stammering can captivate an audience and make them listen carefully. That is why many employers test this ability simultaneously while checking your speech.</p>
        <h3><strong>Initiative</strong></h3>
        <p>Taking initiative is a mark of excellent leadership skills. In the beginning, panel members see if you try to&nbsp;<a href="https://in.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/verbal-communication-examples">start the conversation</a>&nbsp;and establish its flow. If you are unable to do that, they also check if you wait for the right moment and take that chance to introduce your idea in a better way. Supporting your speech with statistics and&nbsp;<a href="https://in.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/communication-skills-in-leadership">some famous quotes also imprints a positive image on the listeners and interviewers</a>.</p>
        <h3><strong>Leadership</strong></h3>
        <p>The panellists usually see if you start with your own viewpoint or ask others for their opinions. Helping others understand the subject matter and considering their perspectives proves your leadership acumen. Panellists also give bonus points if you can capitalise on other's viewpoints, adjust the conversation's flow and direct it towards actionable decisions.</p>
        <h3><strong>Active listening</strong></h3>
        <p>Active listening is an important skill for managerial positions or customer service roles. In a typical group, all members try to stress their points to get some limelight. So, employers usually observe those who listen to their peers without interruption. Letting them speak by giving a response and mentioning their views when you conclude the discussion shows them that you are an active listener.</p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Extempore</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Meaning</strong></p>
        <p>Extempore is a Latin word which means &ldquo;Out of the Moment&rdquo;; in other words, we can say &lsquo;at the time.&rsquo; For example, a speech delivered at the moment without any script, a judgment was given by a judge instantly after the hearing, a person spent 1000 instead of 500 as he planed is Extempore.</p>
        <p><strong>Concept</strong></p>
        <p>Extempore is a speech given at the spur of the moment without any prior preparation. At times there are few minutes given to prepare for a topic like 2-3 mins, usually, that is not the case. Extempore is conducted to understand various points from a candidate and hence has a lot of challenges.</p>
        <p>An extempore speech is an impromptu speech which the candidate is required to make on a topic given there and then. No prior preparation would be permissible.</p>
        <p>Extempore is an activity in which topics are given on the spot, and candidates have to speak and perform on the given topic. Candidates need thinking abilities and good communication skills to ace the extempore topics. They also need to maintain a positive attitude and convincing body language. The potential to speak on extempore topics in front of a large number of people is a truly distinctive task.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The extempore presentation would evaluate the candidate on the following rules:-</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ability to think off the feet:</strong>Since the candidate is required to speak on the spur of the moment, it gauges the candidate&rsquo;s ability to think, organize and speak there and then.</li>
          <li><strong>Analysis of the topic and identification of the issue to be addressed:</strong>An extempore has a huge probability of going in a random and directionless manner if proper analysis does not precede the speech. The candidate is advised to understand the key issues which need to be addressed and then logically position them to create a coherent and well knitted presentation.</li>
          <li><strong>Idea generation:</strong>The biggest challenge in an extempore speech is to come out with a quick sequence of ideas. This assumes even stronger proportions because of limited time available for the task.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritization and sequencing to display logical thinking:</strong>The challenge is not just to speak under time pressure, but also to make logical sense through systematic and rational listing of ideas. This becomes even more critical if the topic is an abstract one and hence dependent on one&rsquo;s perception.</li>
          <li><strong>Ability to connect with the panel:</strong>The time available for the technical extempore presentation is of five minutes. In this limited time span, the candidate is expected to do justice to the topic, which is more likely to happen if he connects well with the panel.</li>
          <li><strong>Language Presentation: </strong>The address particularly has to be in professional English language with no mix of any other language including proverb.</li>
          <li><strong>Communication skills:</strong>The address particularly has to be in professional English</li>
        </ul>
        <p>language with no mix of any other language. These are important as the effectiveness of the presentation is critically determined by communication skills &ndash; both verbal and non-verbal. While articulation, fluency and modulation are key determinants of verbal effectiveness; energy, eye contact and gestures mark the efficacy of non-verbal connect.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Overall presentation skills:</strong>Like body language, confidence, poise &amp; composure &ndash; also have an important role to play in enhancing the quality of the extempore speech.</li>
          <li><strong>Time Boundary:</strong>An extempore is usually anywhere between 2 to 5 minutes. This time limit should be respected.</li>
          <li><strong>Preparation Time:</strong>Candidates would be given a topic, and he/she would be expected to speak on the topic within two minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>A presentation is a form of communication in which a speaker delivers information to an audience. For instance, researchers often present their research to scholars in their field, while businessmen often present their company progress to colleagues.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Developing strong presentation skills is important because presentations are vital to professional communication. Effective presentations can enhance a speaker's academic and professional credibility.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A presentation is a form of&nbsp;<a href="https://businessjargons.com/communication.html"><u>communication</u></a>&nbsp;in which the speaker conveys information to the audience. In an&nbsp;<a href="https://businessjargons.com/organization.html"><u>organization</u></a>&nbsp;presentations are used in various scenarios like talking to a group, addressing a meeting, demonstrating or introducing a new product, or briefing a team. It involves presenting a particular subject or issue or new ideas/thoughts to a group of people.</p>
        <p>In small presentations, we can make use of a blackboard, graphs, charts and slides as a visual aid. Whereas, in large presentations, we can make use of films, slides, videos, animations or modern computer graphics, as a visual aid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2><strong>Parts of Presentation</strong></h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Introduction</strong>: It is meant to make the listeners ready to receive the message and draw their interest. For that, the speaker can narrate some story or a humorous piece of joke, an interesting fact, a question, stating a problem, and so forth. They can also use some surprising statistics.</li>
          <li><strong>Body</strong>: It is the essence of the presentation. It requires the sequencing of facts in a logical order. This is the part where the speaker explains the topic and relevant information. It has to be critically arranged, as the audience must be able to grasp what the speaker presents.</li>
          <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It needs to be short and precise. It should sum up or outline the key points that you have presented. It could also contain what the audience should have gained out of the presentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Purpose of Presentation</strong></h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>To inform</strong>: Organizations can use presentations to inform the audience about new schemes, products or proposals. The aim is to inform the new entrant about the policies and procedures of the organization.</li>
          <li><strong>To persuade</strong>: Presentations are also given to persuade the audience to take the intended action.</li>
          <li><strong>To build goodwill</strong>: They can also help in building a good reputation</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Requisites of Presentation </strong></p>
        <h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
        <h3><strong>1. Have An Agenda.</strong></h3>
        <p>A good way to begin your presentation is to start with an overview so your audience knows there&rsquo;s a focused agenda and a purpose to what they&rsquo;re listening to. Once you&rsquo;ve provided that outline, you&rsquo;ll want to engage your audience and hold their attention by explaining &ldquo;what is&rdquo; (what is the problem, idea, process, etc.) that you want to explain or change. Then you can discuss &ldquo;what could be&rdquo;. This is what the outcome of your solution could look like or how this new process can better your listeners' current experiences.<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>2. Keep It Simple</strong></h3>
        <p>Keep your audience in mind &ndash; long, over-complicated sentences, too many statistics and numbers or even never-ending stories can all serve to overwhelm your audience. A straightforward and focused presentation that moves at a steady pace will keep your listeners engaged and intrigued.<br /><br />A good way to keep it simple: use and stick to a 3-part list with the main points outlined in your introduction. Reiterate the points at the beginning and end, and there&rsquo;s a better chance your audience will have a strong takeaway of the key information.</p>
        <h3><strong>3</strong><strong>. Use Visuals.</strong></h3>
        <p>Help your audience visualize what you are saying by using imagery. Images help the audience remain engaged, whether you include pictures, graphs, charts, or animations. These&nbsp;visuals will only help enhance and reinforce the main points of your presentation.<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>4. </strong><strong>Be Honest And Conversational.</strong></h3>
        <p>Many of the most powerful speakers and speeches capture the attention of their audiences because they are passionate, firm&nbsp;and educated on their topic. And trust us, the audience can tell. Prior to giving a presentation, you should, of course, feel knowledgeable and confident about the topic you are discussing, and if possible, you should feel passionate about your topic of discussion<strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This can only help your audience connect more with your presentation. Use stories, real-life examples and ask and answer questions to help fuel this engagement.</p>
        <h2><strong>4.Choose your content</strong></h2>
        <p>When developing a presentation, the first thing to do is decide on what you&rsquo;re presenting. Choose a single subject; by focusing on a small amount of information, you won&rsquo;t overwhelm your audience. This also gives them the time and opportunity to really understand the position or reasoning on why you are giving a presentation in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Start by creating a high-level outline that captures three main ideas about the topic you are presenting on. At this stage, you don&rsquo;t have to get too into the weeds on what your presentation will include; just sketch out the idea and some supporting statements. This information can later inform what topics to include or ignore, visuals, and, in the end, how many slides you&rsquo;re aiming for.</p>
        <h2><strong>6. Understand your audience</strong></h2>
        <p>People change their way of speaking when talking with a child versus when talking with an adult. It&rsquo;s the same in the workplace; you might be more informal with a coworker with whom you are close. Then you would speak another way with your boss or the company&rsquo;s CEO.</p>
        <p>But there&rsquo;s more to think about when it comes to understanding your audience: what&rsquo;s their background, and level of familiarity with the subject? What is their educational background? Is the subject something they would be naturally interested in, or do you think a particular idea will meet with some resistance?</p>
        <h2><strong>7.Develop the structure</strong></h2>
        <p>Once you know the what and how, you can plan out your presentation. This is where you decide what content will go on each slide, in what order. Some good rules of thumb:</p>
        <h5><strong>ONE IDEA, ONE SLIDE</strong></h5>
        <p>Keep the content of each slide focused on a single idea that supports the subject you&rsquo;re discussing. This information should be straightforward and easily summarized by a visual. More information has the potential to easily become too much text, which can become a problem of its own. One big complaint mentioned in the 2017 Annoying Presentation Survey was that presenters often ended up simply reading their own slides. When that happens, you know the presentation should have been an email.</p>
        <h5><strong>CUT DOWN ON THE TEXT</strong></h5>
        <p>Continuing the same thought from above, less text means there&rsquo;s less of a chance that your audience will become overwhelmed and mentally check out, constantly looking at their watch for when your presentation will end. Trying to include too many thoughts on one slide is the fastest way to intimidate and scare away your audience. Keep it simple, and keep it focused.</p>
        <h5><strong>CLEAR IS MORE</strong></h5>
        <p>As we said before, don&rsquo;t concentrate on keeping the number of slides in your presentation to a minimum; use as many slides as are needed to fully explain the idea. A good rule to work by is one slide per minute you have to present in; so if you have 30 minutes, use 30 slides. The important thing to focus on is ensuring your slides themselves do not overwhelm the audience with content.</p>
        <h5><strong>PROVIDE A MAP</strong></h5>
        <p>One great way to keep your audience focused on your presentation is to tell them where you all are within the presentation. This can be done with slides that are structured like a document&rsquo;s table of contents, or a high-level agenda. They can be placed between sections to show what has come before, and what&rsquo;s still to come; or they can be included in the design of the slides themselves, such as in a header or footer on the slide.&nbsp;</p>
