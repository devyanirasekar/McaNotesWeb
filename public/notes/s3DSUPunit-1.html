        <p><strong><h1>DATA SCIENCE AND BUSNIESS BUZZWORDS</h1></strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Data science is a deep study of the massive amount of data, which involves extracting meaningful insights from raw, structured, and unstructured data that is processed using the scientific method, different technologies, and algorithms.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>It is a multidisciplinary field that uses tools and techniques to manipulate the data so that you can find something new and meaningful.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Data science uses the most powerful hardware, programming systems, and most efficient algorithms to solve the data related problems. It is the future of artificial intelligence.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In short, we can say that data science is all about:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>○ </strong><strong>Asking the correct questions and analyzing the raw data.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>○ </strong><strong>Modeling the data using various complex and efficient algorithms.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>○ </strong><strong>Visualizing the data to get a better perspective.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>○ </strong><strong>Understanding the data to make better decisions and finding the final result.</strong></p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p><strong>Let suppose we want to travel from station A to station B by car. Now, we need to take some decisions such as which route will be the best route to reach faster at the location, in which route there will be no traffic jam, and which will be cost-effective. All these decision factors will act as input data, and we will get an appropriate answer from these decisions, so this analysis of data is called the data analysis, which is a part of data science.</strong></p>
        <p>Need for Data Science:</p>
        <p><strong>Some years ago, data was less and mostly available in a structured form, which could be easily stored in excel sheets, and processed using BI tools.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>But in today's world, data is becoming so vast, i.e., approximately 2.5 quintals bytes of data is generating on every day, which led to data explosion. It is estimated as per researches, that by 2020, 1.7 MB of data will be created at every single second, by a single person on earth. Every Company requires data to work, grow, and improve their businesses.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Now, handling of such huge amount of data is a challenging task for every organization. So to handle, process, and analysis of this, we required some complex, powerful, and efficient algorithms and technology, and that technology came into existence as data Science. Following are some main reasons for using data science technology:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization&rsquo;s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The accelerating volume of data sources, and subsequently data, has made data science is one of the fastest growing field across every industry. Organizations are increasingly reliant on them to interpret data and provide actionable recommendations to improve business outcomes.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The data science lifecycle involves various roles, tools, and processes, which enables analysts to glean actionable insights. Typically, a data science project undergoes the following stages:</strong></p>
        <p><strong><u>Data ingestion: </u></strong><strong>The lifecycle begins with the data collection--both raw structured and unstructured data from all relevant sources using a variety of methods. These methods can include manual entry, web scraping, and real-time streaming data from systems and devices. Data sources can include structured data, such as customer data, along with unstructured data like log files, video, audio, pictures, the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, and more.</strong></p>
        <p><strong><u>Data storage and data processing: </u></strong><strong>Since data can have different formats and structures, companies need to consider different storage systems based on the type of data that needs to be captured. Data management teams help to set standards around data storage and structure, which facilitate workflows around analytics, machine learning and deep learning models. This stage includes cleaning data, deduplicating, transforming and combining the data using ETL (extract, transform, load) jobs or other data integration technologies. This data preparation is essential for promoting data quality before loading into a data warehouse, </strong><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lake"><strong>data</strong></a> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lake"><strong>lake</strong></a><strong>, or other repository.</strong></p>
        <p><strong><u>Data analysis: </u></strong><strong>Here, data scientists conduct an exploratory data analysis to examine biases, patterns, ranges, and distributions of values within the data. This data analytics exploration drives hypothesis generation for a/b testing. It also allows analysts to determine the data&rsquo;s relevance for use within modeling efforts for predictive analytics, machine learning, and/or deep learning. Depending on a model&rsquo;s accuracy, organizations can become reliant on these insights for business decision making, allowing them to drive more scalability.</strong></p>
        <p><strong><u>Communicate: </u></strong><strong>Finally, insights are presented as reports and other data visualizations that make the insights&mdash;and their impact on business&mdash;easier for business analysts and other decision-makers to understand. A data science programming language such as R or Python includes components for generating visualizations; alternately, data scientists can use dedicated visualization tools.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Certainly! In the field of data science, like many other industries, there are certain buzzwords or terms that are commonly used to describe concepts, practices, or trends.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Here are a few business buzzwords in data science and their explanations:</strong></p>
        <h1>Business buzzwords</h1>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> *Big Data:*</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Refers to the massive volume of data that organizations collect and analyze, often coming from various sources. It encompasses structured and unstructured data and requires advanced tools and techniques to derive insights from it.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The term &lsquo;Big Data&rsquo; is used to describe repositories of data so huge that they defy traditional processing techniques. More broadly, the term &lsquo;big data&rsquo; is also used to describe the methods relating to the management of these types of datasets. The sources of big data include everything from credit cards to surveillance, social media, and electronic communications. Big data is often categorized into three types:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> social data (from social media platforms)</strong></li>
          <li><strong> machine data (generated by computers and devices)</strong></li>
          <li><strong> transactional data (where data is exchanged between two parties)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2 Structured and unstructured data</h2>
        <p><strong>All data is either &lsquo;structured&rsquo; or &lsquo;unstructured.&rsquo; Most data starts life in an unstructured format: disorganized, text-heavy, and without any underlying configuration. Big data, in particular, is usually unstructured (at least to begin with). This makes it hard to navigate or use. To get a dataset into a useful format that can be analyzed, we must structure it. Structured data has been organized into databases, spreadsheets, or content management systems. It is often ordered into rows and columns, too, making it much easier to navigate.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Structuring data is a large part of a data analyst&rsquo;s job.</strong></p>
        <h2>3. Algorithm</h2>
        <p><strong>In data analytics, you&rsquo;ll continuously hear about algorithms. From machine learning to decision tree and random forest, a whole bunch of analytical techniques rely on them. But what is an algorithm? Simply put, it is a carefully defined, step-by-step process that is used to solve logical or mathematical problems. In terms of data analytics, these algorithms are carried out by computers. In day-to-day life, any task you run on your phone or laptop will be carried out by an algorithm. Within data analytics, algorithms are used to streamline tasks that computers can carry out much faster and more accurately than humans. This makes them perfect for sorting, parsing, or analyzing big datasets.</strong></p>
        <h2>4. Predictive and prescriptive analytics</h2>
        <p><strong>Two core tenets of data analytics are predictive and prescriptive analytics. Predictive analytics uses algorithms to predict (or make informed guesses about) what is likely to happen in the future, based on existing data. Meanwhile, prescriptive analytics recommends a course of action based on these predictions. Courses of action may be intended to shape future outcomes or to simply take advantage of existing ones. The power of predictive and prescriptive analytics is commonly used by businesses to drive profit, improve customer experiences, and to stay ahead of the competition</strong></p>
        <h2>5. Regression and classification</h2>
        <p><strong>Regression and classification are two types of models commonly used in predictive analytics. Classification is used in machine learning to predict or identify discrete categories of data. Meanwhile, regression models are used to identify continuous values of data. Without getting into the details, the broad takeaway here is that classification is about predicting labels (e.g. red, blue, green, etc.), while regression is about predicting quantities (e.g. probabilities, temperature, or sums, etc.).</strong></p>
        <h2>6. Artificial intelligence (AI)</h2>
        <p><strong>AI is the pursuit of creating machines that can learn. Artificial intelligence uses algorithms designed to mimic the way humans think. While the ultimate aim of AI is to create machines that can think (and even feel) the way humans do. It does have a powerful range of applications in areas as diverse as environmental management and vaccine development.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>It&rsquo;s also used in everyday technologies, from smart phones to self-driving cars.</strong></p>
        <ol start="7">
          <li><strong> Machine Learning:* A subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It's used in various applications, such as recommendation systems and predictive analytics.Machine learning (ML) algorithms learn without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning first evolved in response to the wider pursuit of artificial intelligence. It has fast become a specialized field in its own right. Since ML algorithms ingest and learn from large amounts of data, they&rsquo;re popular for predictive analytics and for making sense of big data. Machine learning is also commonly used to carry out tasks that would be impractical or time-consuming for people to carry out (for instance, managing search engine results).</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>8. Supervised and unsupervised learning</h2>
        <p><strong>Supervised and unsupervised learning are two types of machine learning. The first, supervised learning, uses labeled training data. This involves an algorithm ingesting many labeled examples of input variables, along with their corresponding outputs. As a result, the algorithm learns to classify new (or unlabeled) data. An unsupervised learning algorithm, however, ingests unlabeled data. It then models the underlying structure and patterns of the data based on its own, i.e. it does not use prescriptive models of how input and output data relate to each other.</strong></p>
        <h2>9. Deep learning</h2>
        <p><strong>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It commonly uses unsupervised learning techniques, in the form of algorithms that mimic the workings of the human brain. As a result, it can solve highly complex tasks in a short amount of time. Deep learning is the closest thing we currently have to human-like artificial intelligence. Deep learning tends to improve with greater amounts of data. As such, whereas less complex approaches rely on data that is mathematically straightforward to process, deep learning can find patterns in data that even humans cannot spot.</strong></p>
        <h2>10. Neural networks</h2>
        <p><strong>A neural network is a type of system within deep learning that is used to solve highly complex problems. It can be used for many things, like complex image processing or for solving protein folding problems. Neural networks apply a layered network of algorithms that aim to recognize the underlying connections between different data. In this respect, it is analogous to the neurons in the human brain. However, neural networks do not mimic the human brain exactly.</strong></p>
        <h2>11. Natural language processing</h2>
        <p><strong>Natural language processing (NLP) is a subset of AI that concerns itself with how computers analyze linguistics and spoken or written language. NLP aims to create computer programs that understand the complexities and nuances of human speech. In this context, the term &lsquo;natural language&rsquo; really means &lsquo;human language,&rsquo; and is used to distinguish it from computer programming languages. NLP algorithms can be applied to both text and spoken word. They&rsquo;re commonly used for things like email filtering, voice recognition in smart assistants, predictive text, and many other data analytics tasks, such as sentiment analysis.</strong></p>
        <h2>12. Internet of Things</h2>
        <p><strong>The Internet of Things (IoT) is what we call the growing network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other tech. These objects collect and exchange data via the internet. Fitbits, smartphones, self-driving cars, e-scooters, industrial machinery, smart speakers, doorbells, and even refrigerators (&lsquo;You need milk!&rsquo;) are all objects that belong to the IoT. The IoT has the potential to make our lives much more convenient and efficient. It&rsquo;s also hoped that IoT can help solve many of the problems that humanity faces, from air pollution to food supply issues. It also comes with potential privacy and cybersecurity problems, though, so there are a few kinks to iron out before we get there.</strong></p>
        <h2>13. Decision tree and random forest</h2>
        <p><a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/what-is-a-decision-tree/"><strong>A</strong></a> <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/what-is-a-decision-tree/"><strong>decision</strong></a> <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/what-is-a-decision-tree/"><strong>tree</strong></a><strong> is a type of algorithm used to support decision-making. It uses a tree-shaped model of decisions, incorporating potential outcomes and chance events. In data analytics, decision trees are commonly used to solve classification and regression problems. </strong><a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/what-is-random-forest/"><strong>Random </strong></a><a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/what-is-random-forest/"><strong>forest</strong></a><strong>, meanwhile, is a more complex and robust variation of the same idea. By using multiple decision trees, it reduces margins of error.</strong></p>
        <h2>14. Python</h2>
        <p><strong>Python is all abuzz right now&hellip;It&rsquo;s a popular programming language used by data analysts. Easy to learn, with many applications, Python has vast libraries suitable for various data analytics tasks. This includes data visualization, regression modeling, data cleaning, and more. According to the TIOBE index (which measures the popularity of programming languages) Python is currently the third most popular language in the world, and its popularity is increasing year by year.</strong></p>
        <h2>15. Data wrangling</h2>
        <p><strong>Data wrangling is the process of collecting raw data, cleaning it, mapping, and storing it in a useful format. A common buzzword, there is often confusion around the term, since it is also commonly used as a catch-all to describe other stages in the data analytics process. This includes planning what data to collect, the process of creating algorithms to collect these data, carrying our exploratory analysis, quality control, creating data structures, and so on.</strong></p>
        <h2>16. Data mining</h2>
        <p><strong>Data mining is the process of discovering previously unknown patterns in large datasets. It involves storing data in a structure (or database) for future use. After data wrangling, data mining is a common next step in the data analytics process. The main difference is that data wrangling is a form of data housekeeping, whereas data mining is all about knowledge discovery. As a buzzword, the term is commonly misused to describe any form of large-scale data manipulation. This confusion is probably due to the fact that it sits at the intersection of many interrelated disciplines, including data analytics, computer science, statistics, and machine learning.</strong></p>
        <h2>17. Business analytics</h2>
        <p><strong>Business analytics is data analytics that focuses specifically on business-related systems and procedures. Its goal is to obtain practical, data-driven insights that can be used to streamline or improve these business processes. Business analysts and data analysts are often used as synonyms, with good reason: they are very similar roles. However, data analysts tend to have a &lsquo;raw data&rsquo; (or statistical) focus, whereas a business analyst is usually more concerned with an organization&rsquo;s structure, operational model and wider industry expertise.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>So, these are few most common data science buzzwords with small description of the same. You might encounter new terminologies as you continue studying the subject. Those will be explained as and when they come your way.</strong></p>
        <p>Data Science Components:</p>
        <p><strong>The main components of Data Science are given below:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Statistics: Statistics is one of the most important components of data science. Statistics is a way to collect and analyze the numerical data in a large amount and finding meaningful insights from it.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Domain Expertise: In data science, domain expertise binds data science together. Domain expertise means specialized knowledge or skills of a particular area. In data science, there are various areas for which we need domain experts.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Data engineering: Data engineering is a part of data science, which involves acquiring, storing, retrieving, and transforming the data. Data engineering also includes metadata (data about data) to the data.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Visualization: Data visualization is meant by representing data in a visual context so that people can easily understand the significance of data. Data visualization makes it easy to access the huge amount of data in visuals.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Advanced computing: Heavy lifting of data science is advanced computing. Advanced computing involves designing, writing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong><u>Difference between Analysis and Analytics</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Are data analysis and data analytics two terms for the same concept? Or they are different, but related, terms?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>It&rsquo;s a common misconception that data analysis and data analytics are the same thing. The generally accepted distinction is:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data analytics is the broad field of using data and tools to make business decisions.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Data analysis, a subset of data analytics, refers to specific actions.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>To explain this confusion&mdash;and attempt to clear it up&mdash;we&rsquo;ll look at both terms, examples, and tools.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>What is data analytics?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Data analytics is a broad term that defines the concept and practice (or, perhaps science and art) of all activities related to data. The primary goal is for data experts, including data scientists, engineers, and analysts, to make it easy for the rest of the business to access and understand these findings.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Data that sits raw, as-is, has no value. Instead, it&rsquo;s what you do with that data that provides value. Data analytics includes all the steps you take, both human- and machine-enabled, to discover, interpret, visualize, and tell the story of patterns in your data in order to drive business strategy and outcomes.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A successful data analytics practice can&mdash;should&mdash;provide a better strategy for where your business can go. When done well, data analytics can help you:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Find trends</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Uncover opportunities</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Predict actions, triggers, or events</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Make decisions</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Like any true practice, data analytics is systematic, consisting of many computational and management steps. Experts stress the word &ldquo;systematic&rdquo;. Being systematic is vital because data analytics uses many different activities and draws on all types and sizes of data sources.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Many subject areas comprise data analytics, including data science, machine learning, and applied statistics. One tangible result of a data analytics practice is likely well-planned reports that use data visualization to tell the story of the most salient points so that the rest of the business&mdash;who aren&rsquo;t data experts&mdash;can understand, develop, and adapt their strategies.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Think of the many ways data analytics can highlight areas of opportunity for your business:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Using facts, not guesses, to understand how your customers engage might mean you change your sales or marketing processes. A bakery might use its data to realize its demand for bread bowls increases in the winter&mdash;which means you don&rsquo;t need to discount the prices when demand is high.</strong></li>
          <li><strong> An increase in cyberattacks might mean you need to take proactive preventative measures.</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Data from a variety of </strong><a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/iot-internet-of-things/"><strong>IoT</strong></a> <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/iot-internet-of-things/"><strong>devices</strong></a><strong> in a certain environment, such as your server room, a power station, or a warehouse, could indicate whether you&rsquo;re providing the safety and reliability you need at the lowest cost possible.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Processes in data analytics</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The data analytics practice encompasses many separate processes, which can comprise a data pipeline:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Collecting and ingesting the data</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Categorizing the data </strong><strong>into structured/unstructured forms, which might also define next actions</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Managing the data</strong><strong>, usually in databases, data lakes, and/or data warehouses</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Storing the data </strong><strong>in </strong><a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/cold-vs-hot-data-storage/"><strong>hot,</strong></a> <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/cold-vs-hot-data-storage/"><strong>warm,</strong></a> <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/cold-vs-hot-data-storage/"><strong>or</strong></a> <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/cold-vs-hot-data-storage/"><strong>cold</strong></a> <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/cold-vs-hot-data-storage/"><strong>storage</strong></a></li>
          <li><strong> Performing ETL (</strong><a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/what-is-etl-extract-transform-load-etl-explained/"><strong>extract,</strong></a> <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/what-is-etl-extract-transform-load-etl-explained/"><strong>transform,</strong></a> <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/what-is-etl-extract-transform-load-etl-explained/"><strong>load</strong></a><strong>)</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Analyzing the data to extract patterns, trends, and insights</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Sharing the data to business users or consumers, often in a dashboard or via specific storage </strong><strong>What is data analysis?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Consider data analysis one slice of the data analytics pie. Data analysis consists of cleaning, transforming, modeling, and questioning data to find useful information. (It&rsquo;s generally agreed that other slices are other activities, from collection to storage to visualization.)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The act of data analysis is usually limited to a single, already prepared dataset. You&rsquo;ll inspect, arrange, and question the data. Today a software or &ldquo;machine&rdquo; usually does a first round of analysis, often directly in one of your databases or tools. But this is augmented by a human who investigates and interrogates the data with more context.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>When you&rsquo;re done analyzing a dataset, you&rsquo;ll turn to other data analytics activities to:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Give others access to the data</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Present the data (ideally with data visualization or storytelling)</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Suggest actions to take based on the data</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>A vital point of data analysis is that the analysis already captures data, meaning data from the past.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Type of data analysis</strong></p>
        <p><strong>There are many types of data analysis techniques. Here are the most well-known:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Text analysis. This is also referred to as Data Mining. This method discovers a pattern in large form data sets using databases or other </strong><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-mining-tools-f701645e0f4c"><strong>data</strong></a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-mining-tools-f701645e0f4c"><strong>mining</strong></a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-mining-tools-f701645e0f4c"><strong>tools</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Statistical analysis. This analysis answers &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; by utilizing past data in dashboard form. Statistic analysis involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and modeling of data.</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Diagnostic analysis. This analysis answers &ldquo;Why did it happen?&rdquo; by seeking the cause from the insights discovered during statistical analysis. This type of analysis is beneficial for identifying behavior patterns of data.</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Predictive analysis. This analysis suggests what is likely to happen by utilizing previous data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/machine-learning-vs-predictive-analytics/"><strong>predictive</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/machine-learning-vs-predictive-analytics/"><strong>analysis</strong></a> <strong>makes predictions about future outcomes based on the data.</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Prescriptive analysis. This type of analysis combines the insights from text, statistical, diagnostic, and predictive analysis to determine the action(s) to take in order to solve a current problem or influence a decision.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Combine these different methods depending on the business need and decision-making process. You have tools in place to automatically collect and measure individual metrics within web traffic, such as:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Location</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Activity per time of day</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Mobile vs PC</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Browsers in use</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Each of those data points is a small part of the overall analysis. Then, humans perform further analysis to determine things like how to optimize your website to:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Improve sales opportunities</strong></li>
          <li><strong> Reduce sales lead time</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Increase revenue</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Analysis that is repeatable can often be converted into a new metric within your analytic platform.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Which is better?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>The outcome of data analytics is more encompassing and beneficial than the output of data analysis alone.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Consider the differences between:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> An analyst sending a business user a spreadsheet of numbers versus creating a dashboard for the user to interact with descriptive analytics.</strong></li>
          <li><strong> A business user receiving a report with the live value of a marketing campaign versus creating a web app that both shows the forecast and lets the user interact with predictive analytics.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The ultimate move is creating a product that makes a data-driven prediction <em>and </em>contacts another system&rsquo;s API is order to produce action&mdash;that&rsquo;s data analytics in action. </strong>Tools for data analytics</p>
        <p><strong>Analytics software are tools that help humans and machines perform the analysis that allows us to make mission-critical business decisions.</strong></p>

        <h1>Data ScienceInfographics</h1>
        <p><strong>An infographic is a collection of imagery, data visualizations like pie charts and bar graphs, and minimal text that gives an easy-to-understand overview of a topic.Infographics use striking, engaging visuals to communicate information quickly and clearly.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Infographics are a valuable tool for visual communication. The most visually unique, creative infographics are often the most effective because they grab our attention and don&rsquo;t let go.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>But it&rsquo;s crucial to remember that the visuals in an infographic must do more than excite and engage. They must help us understand and remember the content of the infographic.</strong></p>
        <br /> <br />
        <p><strong>Why are infographics used?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Infographics can be useful whenever you need to communicate information quickly, or any time you want to make an impact with your data or your message. In addition to grabbing a reader&rsquo;s attention, infographics are used to help make complex information easy to digest. They are useful tools if you want to:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Provide a quick overview of a topic</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Present Survey Data</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Simplify a Complex Concept</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Explain how something works</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Show the history or evolution</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Informational Infographic is used for providing a quick overview of a topic. Informational infographics are hugely popular for use on social media. The below example was created to visually enhance the title of an article. By using icons, shapes colours and other visual elements, emphasis was placed on the most important information to help the user understand quickly what the article is about.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Statistical Infographic is used for presenting survey data. Infographics are highly useful when presenting results gathered from survey data. Statistics and numbers can overwhelm audiences, resulting in a loss of their attention. The use of an infographic helps readers quickly obtain the most meaningful data.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>A statistical infographic puts the focus on your data. The layout and visuals will help you tell the story behind the data and what is most important for the readers to remember.</strong></p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><strong>Simplifying the Complex Infographic is used for presenting an overview of a topic in an easy-to-understand visual. The main purpose of an infographic is to simplify a complex idea, specifically when presenting an overview of a topic instead of an in-depth explanation. When complex topics and data are presented in raw form (text), they can be difficult to deliver and understand, but when they are condensed and shown visually, they can become much easier to understand.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Process Infographic is used for explaining how something works. In addition to simplifying complex ideas, infographics are often used to reveal the details behind how intricate objects work. Process infographics will allow you to simplify and clarify each step.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Most process infographics follow a straightforward top-to-bottom or left-to-right flow.</strong></p>
        <ol start="5">
          <li><strong>Timeline Infographic is used for visualising the history of something. Organisations use timeline infographics to display the history or progression of something.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Using graphics or images to highlight important dates, or to give an overview of events (for example, a project timeline) can help the reader have a clear understanding of a timeframe.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Infographics are a way to dress up your content and capture the attention of your audience. They are useful to use across multiple platforms. For example, you can create an infographic about your business&rsquo;s product and share it:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>On your product page (showing how the product works)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>On your blog (split into sections to emphasise different points of an article)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>On social media platforms (with link back to landing page, product page, blog, etc.)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In your email (as a way to break up the text &ndash; highlighting the most important details you wish the reader to understand)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>As an advertisement (print or digital)</strong></p>

When an Image is Recognized, the data analysis is done on one&rsquo;s Facebook friends and after analysis, if the faces which are present in the picture matched with someone else profile then Facebook suggests us auto-tagging.</strong></p>

          <li><strong>Targeting Recommendation</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Targeting Recommendation is the most important application of Data Science. Whatever the user searches on the Internet, he/she will see numerous posts everywhere. This can be explained properly with an example: Suppose I want a mobile phone, so I just Google search it and after that, I changed my mind to buy offline. In Real -World Data Science helps those companies who are paying for Advertisements for their mobile. So everywhere on the internet in the social media, in the websites, in the apps everywhere I will see the recommendation of that mobile phone which I searched for. So this will force me to buy online.</strong></p>
