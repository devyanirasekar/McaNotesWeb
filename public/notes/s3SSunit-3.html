        <p><strong><h1>Interview:</h1></strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>What Is An Interview?</strong></p>
        <p>An interview is a discussion or conversation between a potential employer and a candidate. It is a selection process designed that helps an employer understand the skills, scrutinize their personality and character traits and check the domain knowledge. In this formal meeting, the employer asks questions&nbsp;<a href="https://in.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/what-is-an-informal-interview"><u>to get information from a candidate</u></a>. Usually, interviews happen during the last phase of the recruitment process and help companies select a suitable candidate for a job role. During an interview, the interviewer may ask you about their salary expectation, whereas you can ask about the job responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Another purpose an interview serves is that it helps in authenticating a candidate's application. Employers use this opportunity to investigate a candidate's claim and check whether they can prove their claims.</p>
        <p><strong>Concept of Interview:</strong></p>
        <p>An interview is a formal conversation between an interviewer and interviewee where the former seeks answers from the latter, which checks their capability in joining the desired post. When broken down into two separate terms, interviews are 'inter' and 'view,' meaning seeing each other.</p>
        <p>An interview plays an important role in the entire selection procedure of a candidate.&nbsp;Further, it serves as the basis for analyzing the interviewee's job-related proficiency, abilities, and technicalities. An interview is a structured conversation where recruiters ask questions, and the interviewee delivers answers.</p>
        <p>Interviews can also be unstructured, open-ended, and free-flowing conversations without predetermined questions. Interviews usually have a limited duration for the process.&nbsp;The traditional or professional face to face interview, commonly known as a one-on-one interview, permits direct questions and follow-ups.</p>
        <h2><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>
        <h2><strong>Objectives of Interview</strong></h2>
        <p>Let's look at some objectives of the interview.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It helps to verify the precision of the provided facts and data by the candidate.</li>
          <li>The interview helps to obtain additional information about the skills and knowledge of the interviewee.</li>
          <li>The interview not only assesses a candidate's skills but also checks their suitability for the job.</li>
          <li>The interview provides the candidate with general facts and necessary descriptions about the job and the company.</li>
          <li>An interview gives an intuition into the candidate's rational knowledge and creativity they possess.</li>
          <li>Job descriptions are given at the time of the interview. The interviewer informs the company's expectations from them.</li>
          <li>Through the interview process, the recruiter gets to know about the candidate's skills and lacks the potential abilities to be trained according to their job role.</li>
          <li>Information flows from both directions, and the interviewee gets to know about the company and the employer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2><strong>Why are Interviews Important?</strong></h2>
        <p>Interviews are considered necessary as it is an excellent way to whittle down a large number of applicants and allow the best ones.&nbsp;Here are some points which highlight the importance of interviews.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interviews play a crucial role in the selection process of the favorable candidate. They help the interviewer choose who is efficient and who is not.</li>
          <li>Resumes do not present a clear picture or inabilities of a candidate; recruiters get to know the candidate's weaknesses and where they need training through the interview procedure.</li>
          <li>If someone asks in an interview about their weaknesses, it's best to answer them honestly. It also shows the candidate's self-awareness about their good and vulnerable traits.</li>
          <li>Interviews are a necessary strategy to know a candidate's potential.</li>
          <li>Through the interviewing process, the employer and the interviewee get to know each other, and the flow of essential information takes place, and all doubts are freed.</li>
          <li>The employer gets to know about the interviewee's actual communicative skills and checks their general skills of writing and speaking through the quality of their responses.</li>
          <li>Employers also get to know about the individuality and personality of the candidate. Also, analyze their social behaviour and confidence in their body language.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong><h2>5&rsquo;s of Interview:</h2></strong></p>
        <p>The key to any interview is preparation and it&rsquo;s amazing how many people underestimate this. We<br />cannot stress enough the importance of being fully prepared for an interview. Below, we have set out<br />some basic underlying principles to assist you, known as the 5 P&rsquo;s (Preparation, Practice, Punctuality, Presentation and Performance)</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Preparation</strong><strong><br /></strong>Researching and preparing the following before your interview will show that you&rsquo;re interested in both the role and the firm (with the added bonus of showing how well organised you are!);</li>
          <li><strong><em> The company/firm</em></strong><br />A good place to start is the website. You&rsquo;ll find a whole host of information from the development of the firm itself to the services they provide and the areas they serve.</li>
          <li><strong><em> Job Specification</em></strong><br />As much as possible, try to familiarise yourself with the job role and what they are looking for in a candidate. If a job specification is not available for the role, use the information you researched about the firm to talk about how you would fit into the firm as a whole.</li>
          <li><strong><em> Your Interviewers</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong>If the information is available, research the people who will be interviewing you. You should know the names of your interviewers prior to attending and company websites often have profiles of their staff members. And if not, there&rsquo;s always LinkedIn!</li>
          <li><strong><em> Format</em></strong><strong><em><br /></em></strong>Many interviews nowadays have different components. Try&nbsp;to confirm beforehand whether your interview will include e.g. a psychometric test.</li>
          <li><strong><em> Your CV</em></strong><br />After all, it&rsquo;s your CV! You can be asked questions on any aspect of it, so make sure you know it inside out.</li>
          <li><strong><em> Questions</em></strong><br />Make sure you prepare AT LEAST three questions to ask at the end. This is your chance to show that you&rsquo;ve done your research and that you have a genuine interest. Examples of questions to ask are; &lsquo;What processes exist to support employees in their career development?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Tell me more about the firm&rsquo;s training programme&rsquo;.</li>
          <li><strong> Practice</strong><strong><br /></strong>Practice makes perfect! Interviews often contain standard questions e.g. &lsquo;What is your biggest strength?&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Talk about a time where you took initiative?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a good idea to practice answers to some of these standard questions. Remember to keep your answers structured and focussed. Here are some further examples of standard interview questions;</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Why would you like to work for this company in particular? (an opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge and research)</li>
          <li>Describe a difficult work scenario and how you managed it.</li>
          <li>What are your career aspirations?</li>
          <li>Reason for Leaving. Remember, don&rsquo;t be too negative or critical about your current/previous employer(s)! Try to put yourself at the centre of the answer, not your old boss (who maybe you didn&rsquo;t get on with?!). Interviewers don&rsquo;t want to hear you tearing strips off your previous employer, they want to hear how you are looking to progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><strong> Punctuality</strong><strong><br /></strong>This one&rsquo;s a no-brainer! To the best of your ability, arrive on time. Aim to get there a little early in case there are any delays en route since, let&rsquo;s be honest, these things happen (did somebody say train strike?!). Confirm the exact address of your interview, check the route you&rsquo;ll take beforehand and where possible, take a contact number so that if you are delayed, you can let them know.</li>
          <li><strong> Presentation</strong><br />First impressions are based largely on appearance and body language. Make sure you&rsquo;re dressed appropriately (even if it&rsquo;s a Zoom/Teams interview!). Make sure you&rsquo;re polite and friendly to everyone you meet and always greet your interviewer(s) with a natural smile and, if invited, a firm handshake.</li>
          <li><strong> Performance</strong><strong><br /></strong>During the interview, try to sit comfortably in a relaxed, open manner (and don&rsquo;t fidget!). Try to keep your voice nice and even and make sure you&rsquo;re speaking clearly. Interviews are nerve-wracking, there&rsquo;s no denying that, but listening to the questions and thinking about your answers will go a long way towards putting yourself at ease. Maintain eye contact throughout and don&rsquo;t be shy about asking for clarification or repetition of a question. It&rsquo;s much better to ask for these than to answer a question that&rsquo;s not actually been asked!</li>
