        <h1>CONCEPT OF PROCESS</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A process is sequential program in execution. A process defines the fundamental unit of computation for the computer. Components of process are :</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Object Program</li>
          <li>Data</li>
          <li>Resources</li>
          <li>Status of the process execution.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Object program i.e. code to be executed. Data is used for executing the program. While executing the program, it may require some resources. Last component is used for verifying the status of the process execution. A process can run to completion only when all requested resources have been allocated to the process. Two or more processes could be executing the same program, each using their own data and resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Processes and Programs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Process is a dynamic entity, that is a program in execution. A process is a sequence of information executions. Process exists in a limited span of time. Two or more processes could be executing the same program, each using their own data and resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Program is a static entity made up of program statement. Program contains the instructions. A program exists at single place in space and continues to exist. A program does not perform the action by itself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When process executes, it changes state. Process state is defined as the current activity of the process.  shows the general form of the process state transition diagram. Process state contains five states. Each process is in one of the states. The states are listed below.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>New</li>
          <li>Ready</li>
          <li>Running</li>
          <li>Waiting</li>
          <li>Terminated(exist)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>New : A process that just been created.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>Ready : Ready processes are waiting to have the processor allocated to them by the operating system so that they can run.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>Running : The process that is currently being executed. A running process possesses all the resources needed for its execution, including the processor.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Waiting : A process that can not execute until some event occurs such as the completion of an I/O operation. The</li>
        </ol>
        <p>running process may become suspended by invoking an I/O module.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="5">
          <li>Terminated : A process that has been released from the pool of executable processes by the operating system.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Diagram for Process State</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whenever processes changes state, the operating system reacts by placing the process PCB in the list that corresponds to its new state. Only one process can be running on any processor at any instant and many processes may be ready and waiting state.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Suspended Processes</h2>
        <p>Characteristics of suspend process</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Suspended process is not immediately available for execution.</li>
          <li>The process may or may not be waiting on an event.</li>
          <li>For preventing the execution, process is suspend by OS, parent process, process itself and an agent.</li>
          <li>Process may not be removed from the suspended state until the agent orders the removal.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Swapping is used to move all of a process from main memory to disk. When all the process by putting it in the suspended state and transferring it to disk.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Reasons for process suspension</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Swapping</li>
          <li>Timing</li>
          <li>Interactive user request</li>
          <li>Parent process request</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Swapping: OS needs to release required main memory to bring in a process that is ready to execute.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Timing: Process may be suspended while waiting for the next time interval.</p>
        <p>Interactive user request: Process may be suspended for debugging purpose by user.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Parent process request: To modify the suspended process or to coordinate the activity of various descendants.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2> Process Control Block (PCB)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Each process contains the process control block (PCB). PCB is the data structure used by the operating system. Operating system groups all information that needs about particular process. Fig. 3.2 shows the process control block.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When a process is created, hardware registers and flags are set to the values provided by the loader or linker. Whenever that process is suspended, the contents of the processor register are usually saved on the stack and the pointer to the related stack frame is stored in the PCB. In this way, the hardware state can be restored when the process is scheduled to run again.</li>

        <h1>SCHEDULING</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiprogramming operating system allows more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and for the loaded process to share the CPU using time multiplexing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The scheduling mechanism is the part of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of particular strategy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2> Scheduling Queues</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When the process enters into the system, they are put into a job queue. This queue consists of all processes in the system. The operating system also has other queues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Device queue is a queue for which a list of processes waiting for a particular I/O device. Each device has its own device queue. Fig. 3.3 shows the queuing diagram of process scheduling. In the fig 3.3, queue is represented by rectangular box. The circles represent the resources that serve the queues. The arrows indicate the flow of processes in the system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Queuing Diagram</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Queues are of two types : ready queue and set of device queues. A newly arrived process is put in the ready queue. Processes are waiting in ready queue for allocating the CPU. Once the CPU is assigned to the process, then process will execute. While executing the process, one of the several events could occur.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The process could issue an I/O request and then place in an I/O queue.</li>
          <li>The process could create new sub process and waits for its termination.</li>
          <li>The process could be removed forcibly from the CPU, as a result of interrupt and put back in the ready queue.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> Two State Process Model</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Process may be in one of two states :
            <ol>
              <li>Running</li>
              <li>Not Running</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When new process is created by OS, that process enters into the system in the running state.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Processes that are not running are kept in queue, waiting their turn to execute. Each entry in the queue is a printer to a particular process. Queue is</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>implemented by using linked list. Use of dispatcher is as follows. When a process interrupted, that process is transferred in the waiting queue. If the process has completed or aborted, the process is discarded. In either case, the dispatcher then select a process from the queue to execute.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Schedules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Schedulers are of three types.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Long Term Scheduler</li>
          <li>Short Term Scheduler</li>
          <li>Medium Term Scheduler</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Long Term Scheduler</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It is also called job scheduler. Long term scheduler determines which programs are admitted to the system for processing. Job scheduler selects processes from the queue and loads them into memory for execution. Process loads into the memory for CPU scheduler. The primary objective of the job scheduler is to provide a balanced mix of jobs, such as I/O bound and processor bound. It also controls the degree of multiprogramming. If the degree of multiprogramming is stable, then the average rate of process creation must be equal to the average departure rate of processes leaving the system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On same systems, the long term scheduler may be absent or minimal. Time-sharing operating systems have no long term scheduler. When process changes the state from new to ready, then there is a long term scheduler.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3> Short Term Scheduler</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It is also called CPU scheduler. Main objective is increasing system performance in accordance with the chosen set of criteria. It is the change of ready state to running state of the process. CPU scheduler selects from among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to one of them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Short term scheduler also known as dispatcher, execute most frequently and makes the fine grained decision of which process to execute next. Short term scheduler is faster than long tern scheduler.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Medium Term Scheduler</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Medium term scheduling is part of the swapping function. It removes the processes from the memory. It reduces the</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>degree of multiprogramming. The medium term scheduler is in charge of handling the swapped out-processes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Medium term scheduler is shown in the Fig. 3.4</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fig 3.4 Queueing diagram with medium term scheduler</p>
        <p>Running process may become suspended by making an I/O request. Suspended processes cannot make any progress towards completion. In this condition, to remove the process from memory and make space for other process. Suspended process is move to the secondary storage is called swapping, and the process is said to be swapped out or rolled out. Swapping may be necessary to improve the process mix.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When the scheduler switches the CPU from executing one process to executing another, the context switcher saves the content of all processor registers for the process being removed from the CPU in its process being removed from the CPU in its process descriptor. The context of a process is represented in the process control block of a process. Context switch time is pure overhead. Context switching can significantly affect performance, since modern computers have a lot of general and status registers to be saved.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Content switch times are highly dependent on hardware support. Context switch requires ( n + m ) bXK time units to save the state of the processor with n general registers, assuming b store operations are required to save register and each store instruction requires K time units. Some hardware systems employ two or more sets of processor registers to reduce the amount of context switching time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When the process is switched the information stored is :

        <h1>3.5 OPERATION ON PROCESSES</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Several operations are possible on the process. Process must be created and deleted dynamically. Operating system must provide the environment for the process operation. We discuss the two main operations on processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a process</li>
          <li>Terminate a process</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>3.5.1 Create Process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Operating system creates a new process with the specified or default attributes and identifier. A process may create several new subprocesses. Syntax for creating new process is :</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CREATE ( processed, attributes )</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Two names are used in the process they are parent process and child process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Parent process is a creating process. Child process is created by the parent process. Child process may create another subprocess. So it forms a tree of processes. When operating system issues a CREATE system call, it obtains a new process control block from the pool of free memory, fills the fields with provided and default parameters, and insert the PCB into the ready list. Thus it makes the specified process eligible to run the process.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When a process is created, it requires some parameters. These are priority, level of privilege, requirement of memory, access right, memory protection information etc. Process will need certain resources, such as CPU time, memory, files and I/O devices to complete the operation. When process creates a subprocess, that subprocess may obtain its resources directly from the operating system. Otherwise it uses the resources of parent process.</li>
          <li>When a process creates a new process, two possibilities exist in terms of execution.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>The parent continues to execute concurrently with its children.</li>
          <li>The parent waits until some or all of its children have terminated.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>For address space, two possibilities occur:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>The child process is a duplicate of the parent process.</li>
          <li>The child process has a program loaded into it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>3.5.2 Terminate a Process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>DELETE system call is used for terminating a process. A process may delete itself or by another process. A process can cause the termination of another process via an appropriate system call. The operating system reacts by reclaiming all resources allocated to the specified process, closing files opened by or for the process. PCB is also removed from its place of residence in the list and is returned to the free pool. The DELETE service is normally invoked as a part of orderly program termination.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Following are the resources for terminating the child process by parent process.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>The task given to the child is no longer required.</li>
          <li>Child has exceeded its usage of some of the resources that it has been allocated.</li>
          <li>Operating system does not allow a child to continue if its parent terminates.</li>
        </ol>

          <h1>1 INTRODUCTION OF THREAD</h1>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A thread is a flow of execution through the process code, with its own program counter, system registers and stack. Threads are a popular way to improve application performance through parallelism. A thread is sometimes called a light weight process.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Threads represent a software approach to improving performance of operating system by reducing the over head</li>
          </ul>
          <p>thread is equivalent to a classical process. Each thread belongs to exactly one process and no thread can exist outside a process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>4.1shows the single and multithreaded process.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Threads have been successfully used in implementing network servers. They also provide a suitable foundation for parallel execution of applications on shared memory multiprocessors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Threads is implemented in two ways :</p>
          <ol>
            <li>User Level</li>
            <li>Kernel Level</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>4.2.1 User Level Thread</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>In a user thread, all of the work of thread management is done by the application and the kernel is not aware of the existence of threads. The thread library contains code for creating and destroying threads, for passing message and data between threads, for scheduling thread execution and for saving and restoring thread contexts. The application begins with a single thread and begins running in that thread.</li>
            <li>4.2 shows the user level thread.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>User level threads are generally fast to create and manage. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Advantage of user level thread over Kernel level thread :</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Thread switching does not require Kernel mode privileges.</li>
            <li>User level thread can run on any operating system.</li>
            <li>Scheduling can be application specific.</li>
            <li>User level threads are fast to create and manage.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Disadvantages of user level thread :</p>
          <ol>
            <li>In a typical operating system, most system calls are blocking.</li>
            <li>Multithreaded application &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot take &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; advantage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of multiprocessing.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>4.2.2 Kernel Level Threads</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>In Kernel level thread, thread management done by the Kernel. There is no thread management code in the application area. Kernel threads are supported directly by the operating system. Any application can be programmed to be multithreaded. All of the threads within an application are supported within a single process. The Kernel maintains context information for the process as a whole and for individuals threads within the process.</li>
            <li>Scheduling by the Kernel is done on a thread basis. The Kernel performs thread creation, scheduling and management in Kernel space. Kernel threads are generally slower to create and manage than the user threads.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Advantages of Kernel level thread:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Kernel can simultaneously schedule multiple threads from the same process on multiple process.</li>
            <li>If one thread in a process is blocked, the Kernel can schedule another thread of the same process.</li>
            <li>Kernel routines themselves can multithreaded.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Disadvantages:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Kernel threads are generally slower to create and manage than the user threads.</li>
            <li>Transfer of control from one thread to another within same process requires a mode switch to the Kernel.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>4.2.3 Advantages of Thread</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Thread minimize context switching time.</li>
            <li>Use of threads provides concurrency within a process.</li>
            <li>Efficient communication.</li>
            <li>Economy- It is more economical to create and context switch threads.</li>
            <li>Utilization of multiprocessor architectures &ndash;</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The benefits of multithreading can be greatly increased in a multiprocessor architecture.</p>

          <h1>4.3 MULTITHREADING MODELS</h1>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some operating system provide a combined user level thread and Kernel level thread facility. Solaris is a good example of this combined approach. In a combined system, multiple threads within the same application can run in parallel on multiple processors and a blocking system call need not block the entire process.</li>
            <li>Multithreading models are three types:</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>Many to many relationship.</li>
            <li>Many to one relationship.</li>
            <li>One to one relationship.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>4.3.1 Many to Many Model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>In this model, many user level threads multiplexes to the Kernel thread of smaller or equal numbers. The number of Kernel threads may be specific to either a particular application or a particular machine.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>4.3 shows the many to many model. In this model, developers can create as many user threads as necessary and the corresponding Kernel threads can run in parallels on a multiprocessor.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>4.3.2 Many to One Model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Many to one model maps many user level threads to one Kernel level thread. Thread management is done in user space. When thread makes a blocking system call, the entire process will be blocks. Only one thread can access the Kernel at a time, so multiple threads are unable to run in parallel on multiprocessors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>4.4 shows the many to one model.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the user level thread libraries are implemented in the operating system, that system does not support Kernel threads use the many to one relationship modes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>4.3.3 One to One Model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>There is one to one relationship of user level thread to the kernel level thread. Fig. 4.5 shows one to one relationship model. This model provides more concurrency than the many to one model.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It also another thread to run when a thread makes a blocking system call. It support multiple thread to execute in parallel on microprocessors. Disadvantage of this model is that creating user thread requires the corresponding Kernel thread. OS/2, windows NT and windows 2000 use one to one relationship model.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>System calls fork and exec is discussed here. In a multithreaded program environment, fork and exec system calls is changed. Unix system have two version of fork system calls. One call duplicates all threads and another that duplicates only the thread that invoke the fork system call. Whether to use one or two version of fork system call totally depends upon the application. Duplicating all threads is unnecessary, if exec is called immediately after fork system call.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thread cancellation is a process of thread terminates before its completion of task. For example, in multiple thread environment, thread concurrently searching through a database. If any one thread returns the result, the remaining thread might be cancelled.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thread cancellation is of two types.</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>Asynchronous cancellation</li>
            <li>Synchronous cancellation</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In asynchronous cancellation, one thread immediately terminates the target thread. Deferred cancellation periodically check for terminate by target thread. It also allow the target thread to terminate itself in an orderly fashion. Some resources are allocated to the thread. If we cancel the thread, which update the data with other thread. This problem may face by asynchronous cancellation system wide resource are not free if threads cancelled asynchronously. Most of the operating system allow a process or thread to be cancelled asynchronously.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h1>1 INTRODUCTION OF THREAD</h1>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A thread is a flow of execution through the process code, with its own program counter, system registers and stack. Threads are a popular way to improve application performance through parallelism. A thread is sometimes called a light weight process.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Threads represent a software approach to improving performance of operating system by reducing the over head</li>
          </ul>
          <p>thread is equivalent to a classical process. Each thread belongs to exactly one process and no thread can exist outside a process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>4.1shows the single and multithreaded process.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Threads have been successfully used in implementing network servers. They also provide a suitable foundation for parallel execution of applications on shared memory multiprocessors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Threads is implemented in two ways :</p>
          <ol>
            <li>User Level</li>
            <li>Kernel Level</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>4.2.1 User Level Thread</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>In a user thread, all of the work of thread management is done by the application and the kernel is not aware of the existence of threads. The thread library contains code for creating and destroying threads, for passing message and data between threads, for scheduling thread execution and for saving and restoring thread contexts. The application begins with a single thread and begins running in that thread.</li>
            <li>4.2 shows the user level thread.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>User level threads are generally fast to create and manage. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Advantage of user level thread over Kernel level thread :</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Thread switching does not require Kernel mode privileges.</li>
            <li>User level thread can run on any operating system.</li>
            <li>Scheduling can be application specific.</li>
            <li>User level threads are fast to create and manage.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Disadvantages of user level thread :</p>
          <ol>
            <li>In a typical operating system, most system calls are blocking.</li>
            <li>Multithreaded application &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot take &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; advantage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of multiprocessing.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>4.2.2 Kernel Level Threads</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>In Kernel level thread, thread management done by the Kernel. There is no thread management code in the application area. Kernel threads are supported directly by the operating system. Any application can be programmed to be multithreaded. All of the threads within an application are supported within a single process. The Kernel maintains context information for the process as a whole and for individuals threads within the process.</li>
            <li>Scheduling by the Kernel is done on a thread basis. The Kernel performs thread creation, scheduling and management in Kernel space. Kernel threads are generally slower to create and manage than the user threads.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Advantages of Kernel level thread:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Kernel can simultaneously schedule multiple threads from the same process on multiple process.</li>
            <li>If one thread in a process is blocked, the Kernel can schedule another thread of the same process.</li>
            <li>Kernel routines themselves can multithreaded.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Disadvantages:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Kernel threads are generally slower to create and manage than the user threads.</li>
            <li>Transfer of control from one thread to another within same process requires a mode switch to the Kernel.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>4.2.3 Advantages of Thread</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Thread minimize context switching time.</li>
            <li>Use of threads provides concurrency within a process.</li>
            <li>Efficient communication.</li>
            <li>Economy- It is more economical to create and context switch threads.</li>
            <li>Utilization of multiprocessor architectures &ndash;</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The benefits of multithreading can be greatly increased in a multiprocessor architecture.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h1>4.3 MULTITHREADING MODELS</h1>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some operating system provide a combined user level thread and Kernel level thread facility. Solaris is a good example of this combined approach. In a combined system, multiple threads within the same application can run in parallel on multiple processors and a blocking system call need not block the entire process.</li>
            <li>Multithreading models are three types:</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>Many to many relationship.</li>
            <li>Many to one relationship.</li>
            <li>One to one relationship.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>4.3.1 Many to Many Model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>In this model, many user level threads multiplexes to the Kernel thread of smaller or equal numbers. The number of Kernel threads may be specific to either a particular application or a particular machine.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>4.3 shows the many to many model. In this model, developers can create as many user threads as necessary and the corresponding Kernel threads can run in parallels on a multiprocessor.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>4.3.2 Many to One Model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Many to one model maps many user level threads to one Kernel level thread. Thread management is done in user space. When thread makes a blocking system call, the entire process will be blocks. Only one thread can access the Kernel at a time, so multiple threads are unable to run in parallel on multiprocessors.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>4.4 shows the many to one model.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the user level thread libraries are implemented in the operating system, that system does not support Kernel threads use the many to one relationship modes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>4.3.3 One to One Model</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>There is one to one relationship of user level thread to the kernel level thread. Fig. 4.5 shows one to one relationship model. This model provides more concurrency than the many to one model.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It also another thread to run when a thread makes a blocking system call. It support multiple thread to execute in parallel on microprocessors. Disadvantage of this model is that creating user thread requires the corresponding Kernel thread. OS/2, windows NT and windows 2000 use one to one relationship model.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>System calls fork and exec is discussed here. In a multithreaded program environment, fork and exec system calls is changed. Unix system have two version of fork system calls. One call duplicates all threads and another that duplicates only the thread that invoke the fork system call. Whether to use one or two version of fork system call totally depends upon the application. Duplicating all threads is unnecessary, if exec is called immediately after fork system call.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thread cancellation is a process of thread terminates before its completion of task. For example, in multiple thread environment, thread concurrently searching through a database. If any one thread returns the result, the remaining thread might be cancelled.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thread cancellation is of two types.</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>Asynchronous cancellation</li>
            <li>Synchronous cancellation</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In asynchronous cancellation, one thread immediately terminates the target thread. Deferred cancellation periodically check for terminate by target thread. It also allow the target thread to terminate itself in an orderly fashion. Some resources are allocated to the thread. If we cancel the thread, which update the data with other thread. This problem may face by asynchronous cancellation system wide resource are not free if threads cancelled asynchronously. Most of the operating system allow a process or thread to be cancelled asynchronously.</li>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Throughput: how many jobs are completed by the cpu with in a timeperiod.</li>
            <li>Turn around time : The time interval between the submission of the process and time of the completion is turn around time.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>TAT = Waiting time in ready queue + executing time + waiting time in waiting queue for I/O.</p>
          <ol start="3">
            <li>Waiting time: The time spent by the process to wait for cpu to beallocated.</li>
            <li>Response time: Time duration between the submission and firstresponse.</li>
            <li>Cpu Utilization: CPU is costly device, it must be kept as busy aspossible. Eg: CPU efficiency is 90% means it is busy for 90 units, 10 units idle.</li>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First come First served scheduling: (FCFS): The process that request the CPU first is holds the cpu first. If a process request the cpu then it is loaded into the ready queue, connect CPU to that process.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Consider the following set of processes that arrive at time 0, the length of the cpu burst time given in milli seconds.</p>
          <p>burst time is the time, required the cpu to execute that job, it is in milli seconds.</p>

          <p>It is designed especially for time sharing systems. Here CPU switches between the processes. When the time quantum expired, the CPU switched to another job. A small unit of time, called a time quantum or time slice. A time quantum is generally from 10 to 100 ms. The time quantum is generally depending on OS. Here ready queue is a circular queue. CPU scheduler picks the first process from ready queue, sets timer to interrupt after one time quantum and dispatches the process.</p>
