        <p><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong></p>
        <p>System is combination of different factors which perform</p>
        <p>different functions. It handles by user and administrator who has a</p>
        <p>knowledge and skill about that system.<strong> </strong></p>
        <p><strong>SYSTEM </strong></p>
        <p>The concept of an 'integrated whole' can also be stated in</p>
        <p>terms of a system embodying a set of relationships which are</p>
        <p>differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and</p>
        <p>from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a</p>
        <p>part of the relational regime.</p>
        
        <p>Systems have structure, defined by parts and their</p>
        <p>composition;</p>
   
        <p>Systems have behavior, which involves inputs, processing</p>
        <p>and outputs of material, energy or information;</p>
        
        <p>Systems have interconnectivity: the various parts of a</p>
        <p>system have functional as well as structural relationships</p>
        <p>between each other.</p>
    
        <p>Systems have by themselves functions or groups of</p>
        <p>functions</p>
        <p><strong> CLASSIFICATION OF SYSTEM : </strong></p>
        <p>Classification of systems can be done in many ways.</p>
        <p><strong> Physical or Abstract System </strong></p>
        <p>Physical systems are tangible entities that we can feel and</p>
        <p>touch. These may be static or dynamic in nature. For example, take a</p>
        <p>computer center. Desks and chairs are the static parts, which</p>
        <p>assist in the working of the center. Static parts don't change. The</p>
        <p>dynamic systems are constantly changing. Computer systems are</p>
        <p>dynamic system. Programs, data, and applications can change</p>
        <p>according to the user's needs.</p>
        <p>Abstract systems are conceptual. These are not physical</p>
        <p>entities. They may be formulas, representation or model of a real</p>
        <p>system.</p>
        <p><strong>Open Closed System </strong></p>
        <p>Systems interact with their environment to achieve their</p>
        <p>targets. Things that are not part of the system are environmental</p>
        <p>elements for the system. Depending upon the interaction with the</p>
        <p>environment, systems can be divided into two categories, open and</p>
        <p>closed.</p>
        <p>Open systems: Systems that interact with their environment.</p>
        <p>Practically most of the systems are open systems. An open</p>
        <p>system</p>
        <p>has many interfaces with its environment. It can also</p>
        <p>adapt to changing environmental conditions. It can receive inputs</p>
        <p>from, and delivers output to the outside of system. An information</p>
        <p>system is an example of this category.</p>
        <p>Closed systems: Systems that don't interact with their</p>
        <p>environment. Closed systems exist in concept only.</p>
        <p><strong> Man made Information System </strong></p>
        <p>The main purpose of information systems is to manage data</p>
        <p>for a particular</p>
        <p>organization.</p>
        <p>Maintaining</p>
        <p>files, producing</p>
        <p>information and reports are few functions. An information system</p>
        <p>produces customized information depending upon the needs of the</p>
        <p>organization. These are usually formal, informal, and computer</p>
        <p>based.</p>
        <p>Formal Information Systems: It deals with the flow of</p>
        <p>information from top management to lower management.</p>
        <p>Information flows in the form of memos, instructions, etc. But</p>
        <p>feedback can be given from lower authorities to top management.</p>
        <p>Informal</p>
        <p>Information</p>
        <p>systems:</p>
        <p>Informal</p>
        <p>systems</p>
        <p>are</p>
        <p>employee based. These are made to solve the day to day work</p>
        <p>related problems. Computer-Based Information Systems: This class of</p>
        <p>systems depends on the use of computer for managing business</p>
        <p>applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Computer Base System: </strong></p>
        <p>A system of one or more computers and associated software</p>
        <p>with common storage called system.</p>
        <p>A computer is a programmable machine that receives input,</p>
        <p>stores and manipulates data, and provides output in a useful</p>
        <p>format.</p>
        <p>The computer elements described thus far are known as</p>
        <p>"hardware." A computer system has three parts: the hardware, the</p>
        <p>software, and the people who make it work.<strong>7 </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Information System: </strong></p>
        <p>An information system (IS) is any combination of information</p>
        <p>technology and people's activities using that technology to support</p>
        <p>operations, management, and decision-making.</p>
        <p>Information system deals with data of the organizations. The</p>
        <p>purposes of Information system are to process input, maintain data,</p>
        <p>produce reports, handle queries, handle on line transactions,</p>
        <p>generate reports, and other output. These maintain huge</p>
        <p>databases, handle hundreds of queries etc. The transformation of</p>
        <p>data into information is primary function of information system.</p>
        <p>Information systems differ in their business needs. Also</p>
        <p>depending upon different levels in organization information systems</p>
        <p>differ. Three major information systems are</p>
        <p>Transaction processing systems</p>
        <p>Management information systems</p>
        <p>Decision support systems</p>
        <p>Figure 1.2 shows relation of information system to the levels of</p>
        <p>organization. The information needs are different at different</p>
        <p>organizational</p>
        <p>levels. Accordingly</p>
        <p>the information</p>
        <p>can be</p>
        <p>categorized as: strategic information, managerial information and</p>
        <p>operational information.</p>
        <p>Strategic information is the information needed by top most</p>
        <p>management for decision making. For example the trends in</p>
        <p>revenues earned by the organization are required by the top</p>
        <p>management for setting the policies of the organization. This</p>
        <p>information is not required by the lower levels in the organization.</p>
        <p>The information systems that provide these kinds of information are</p>
        <p>known as Decision Support Systems.<strong>8 </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Figure - Relation of information systems to levels of </strong></p>
        <p><strong>organization </strong></p>
        <p>The second category of information required by the middle</p>
        <p>management is known as managerial information. The information</p>
        <p>required at this level is used for making short term decisions and</p>
        <p>plans for the organization. Information like sales analysis for the</p>
        <p>past quarter or yearly production details etc. fall under this</p>
        <p>category. Management information system (MIS) caters to such</p>
        <p>information needs of the organization. Due to its capabilities to fulfill the</p>
        <p>managerial information needs of the organization, Management</p>
        <p>Information Systems have become a necessity for all big</p>
        <p>organizations. And due to its vastness, most of the big</p>
        <p>organizations have separate MIS departments to look into the</p>
        <p>related issues and proper functioning of the system.</p>
        <p>The third category of information is relating to the daily or</p>
        <p>short term information needs of the organization such as</p>
        <p>attendance records of the employees. This kind of information is</p>
        <p>required at the operational level for carrying out the day-to-day</p>
        <p>operational activities. Due to its capabilities to provide information for</p>
        <p>processing transaction of the organization, the information system</p>
        <p>is known as Transaction Processing System or Data Processing</p>
        <p>System. Some examples of information provided by such systems</p>
        <p>are processing of orders, posting of entries in bank, evaluating</p>
        <p>overdue purchaser orders etc.</p>
        <p><strong> Transaction Processing Systems </strong></p>
        <p>TPS processes business transaction of the organization.</p>
        <p>Transaction can be any activity of the organization. Transactions</p>
        <p>differ from organization to organization. For example, take a railway</p>
        <p>reservation system. Booking, cancelling, etc are all transactions.<strong>9 </strong></p>
        <p>Any query made to it is a transaction. However, there are</p>
        <p>some transactions, which are common to almost all organizations.</p>
        <p>Like employee new employee, maintaining their leave status,</p>
        <p>maintaining employees accounts, etc.</p>
        <p>This provides high speed and accurate processing of record</p>
        <p>keeping of basic operational processes. These include calculation,</p>
        <p>storage and retrieval.</p>
        <p>Transaction processing systems provide speed and</p>
        <p>accuracy, and can be programmed to follow routines functions of the</p>
        <p>organization.</p>
        <p><strong>Management Information Systems: </strong></p>
        <p>These systems assist lower management in problem solving</p>
        <p>and making decisions. They use the results of transaction</p>
        <p>processing and some other information also. It is a set of</p>
        <p>information processing functions. It should handle queries as</p>
        <p>quickly as they arrive. An important element of MIS is database.</p>
        <p>A database is a non-redundant collection of interrelated data</p>
        <p>items that can be processed through application programs and</p>
        <p>available to many users.</p>
        <p><strong> Decision Support Systems: </strong></p>
        <p>These systems assist higher management to make long</p>
        <p>term decisions. These type of systems handle unstructured or semi</p>
        <p>structured decisions. A decision is considered unstructured if there are</p>
        <p>no clear procedures for making the decision and if not all the factors</p>
        <p>to be considered in the decision can be readily identified in advance.</p>
        <p>These are not of recurring nature. Some recur infrequently or</p>
        <p>occur only once. A decision support system must very flexible. The</p>
        <p>user should be able to produce customized reports by giving</p>
        <p>particular data and format specific to particular situations.</p>
        <p><strong> SYSTEM ANALYSIS : </strong></p>
        <p>Systems analysis is the study of sets of interacting entities,</p>
        <p>including computer systems. This field is closely related to</p>
        <p>operations research. It is also "an explicit formal carried out to help ,</p>
        <p>referred to as the decision maker, identify a better course of</p>
        <p>action.</p>
        <p>Computers are fast becoming our way of life and one cannot</p>
        <p>imagine life without computers in today&rsquo;s world. You go to a railway<strong>10 </strong></p>
        <p>station for reservation, you want to web site a ticket for a cinema,</p>
        <p>you go to a library, or you go to a bank, you will find computers at all</p>
        <p>places. Since computers are used in every possible field today, it</p>
        <p>becomes an important issue to understand and build these</p>
        <p>computerized systems in an effective way.</p>
        <p><strong>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING: </strong></p>
        <p>Software Engineering is the systematic approach to the</p>
        <p>development, operation and maintenance of software. Software</p>
        <p>Engineering is concerned with development and maintenance of</p>
        <p>software products.</p>
        <p>Software engineering (SE) is a profession dedicated to</p>
        <p>designing, implementing, and modifying software so that it is of</p>
        <p>higher quality, more affordable, maintainable, and faster to build. It is</p>
        <p>a "systematic approach to the analysis, design, assessment,</p>
        <p>implementation, test, maintenance and reengineering of software,</p>
        <p>that is, the application of engineering to software.</p>
        <p>The primary goal of software engineering is to provide the</p>
        <p>quality of software with low cost. Software Engineering involves</p>
        <p>project planning, project management, systematic analysis, design,</p>
        <p>validations and maintenance activities.</p>
        <p>Every Engineer wants to design the general theme for to</p>
        <p>develop the software. So, the stepwise execution is necessary to</p>
        <p>develop a good software. It is called as software engineering.</p>
        <p><strong>SYSTEM DESIGN : </strong></p>
        <p>Systems design is the process or art of defining the</p>
        <p>architecture,</p>
        <p>components,</p>
        <p>modules,</p>
        <p>interfaces,</p>
        <p>and data for</p>
        <p>a system to satisfy specified requirements. One could see it as the</p>
        <p>application of systems theory to product development. There is</p>
        <p>some overlap with the disciplines of systems analysis, systems</p>
        <p>architecture and systems engineering.</p>
        <p><strong>System design is divided into two types: </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Logical Design </strong></p>
        <p>The logical design of a system pertains to an abstract</p>
        <p>representation of the data flows, inputs and outputs of the system.</p>
        <p>This is often conducted via modeling, which involves a simplistic</p>
        <p>(and sometimes graphical) representation of an actual system. In</p>
        <p>the context of systems design, modeling can undertake the</p>
        <p>following forms, including:<strong>11 </strong></p>
        <p> Data flow diagrams</p>
        <p> Entity Life Histories</p>
        <p> Entity Relationship Diagrams</p>
        <p><strong> Physical Design </strong></p>
        <p>The physical design relates to the actual input and output</p>
        <p>processes of the system. This is laid down in terms of how data is</p>
        <p>inputted into a system, how it is verified/authenticated, how it is</p>
        <p>processed, and how it is displayed as output.</p>
        <p>Physical design, in this context, does not refer to the tangible</p>
        <p>physical design of an information system. To use an analogy, a</p>
        <p>personal computer's physical design involves input via a keyboard,</p>
        <p>processing within the CPU, and output via a monitor, printer, etc. It</p>
        <p>would not concern the actual layout of the tangible hardware, which for</p>
        <p>a PC would be a monitor, CPU, motherboard, hard drive,</p>
        <p>modems, video/graphics cards, USB slots, etc.</p>
        <p>System Design includes following points:</p>
        <p> Requirements analysis - analyzes the needs of the end users or</p>
        <p>customers</p>
        <p> Benchmarking &mdash; is an effort to evaluate how current systems are</p>
        <p>used</p>
        <p> Systems architecture - creates a blueprint for the design with the</p>
        <p>necessary specifications for the hardware, software, people and</p>
        <p>data resources. In many cases, multiple architectures are</p>
        <p>evaluated before one is selected.</p>
        <p> Design &mdash; designers will produce one or more 'models' of what</p>
        <p>they see a system eventually looking like, with ideas from the</p>
        <p>analysis section either used or discarded. A document will be</p>
        <p>produced with a description of the system, but nothing is</p>
        <p>specific &mdash; they might say 'touch screen' or 'GUI operating</p>
        <p>system', but not mention any specific brands;</p>
        <p> Computer programming and debugging in the software world, or</p>
        <p>detailed design in the consumer, enterprise or commercial world</p>
        <p>- specifies the final system components.</p>
        <p> System testing - evaluates the system's actual functionality in</p>
        <p>relation to expected or intended functionality, including all</p>
        <p>integration aspects.</p>
        <p><strong>SYSTEM ANALYST: </strong></p>
        <p>The system analyst is the person (or persons) who guides</p>
        <p>through the development of an information system. In performing<strong>12 </strong></p>
        <p>these tasks the analyst must always match the information system</p>
        <p>objectives with the goals of the organization.</p>
        <p><strong>Role of System Analyst: </strong></p>
        <p>Role of System Analyst differs from organization to</p>
        <p>organization. Most common responsibilities of System Analyst are</p>
        <p>following :</p>
        <p><strong>1) System analysis </strong></p>
        <p>It includes system's study in order to get facts about</p>
        <p>business activity. It is about getting information and determining</p>
        <p>requirements. Here the responsibility includes only requirement</p>
        <p>determination, not the design of the system.</p>
        <p><strong>2) System analysis and design: </strong></p>
        <p>Here apart from the analysis work, Analyst is also</p>
        <p>responsible for the designing of the new system/application.</p>
        <p><strong>3) Systems analysis, design, and programming: </strong></p>
        <p>Here Analyst is also required to perform as a programmer,</p>
        <p>where he actually writes the code to implement the design of the</p>
        <p>proposed application.</p>
        <p>Due to the various responsibilities that a system analyst</p>
        <p>requires to handle, he has to be multifaceted person with varied</p>
        <p>skills required at various stages of the life cycle. In addition to the</p>
        <p>technical know-how of the information system development a</p>
        <p>system analyst should also have the following knowledge.</p>
        <p>!</p>
        <p>Business knowledge: As the analyst might have to develop any</p>
        <p>kind of a business system, he should be familiar with the</p>
        <p>general functioning of all kind of businesses.</p>
        <p>!</p>
        <p>Interpersonal skills: Such skills are required at various stages of</p>
        <p>development process for interacting with the users and</p>
        <p>extracting the requirements out of them</p>
        <p>!</p>
        <p>Problem solving skills: A system analyst should have enough</p>
        <p>problem solving skills for defining the alternate solutions to the</p>
        <p>system and also for the problems occurring at the various</p>
        <p>stages of the development process.</p>
        <p><strong> Task of System Analyst: </strong></p>
        <p>The primary objective of any system analyst is to identify the</p>
        <p>need of the organization by acquiring information by various means</p>
        <p>and methods. Information acquired by the analyst can be either</p>
        <p>computer based or manual. Collection of information is the vital<strong>13 </strong></p>
        <p>step as indirectly all the major decisions taken in the organizations are</p>
        <p>influenced. The system analyst has to coordinate with the system</p>
        <p>users, computer programmers, manager and number of people</p>
        <p>who are related with the use of system. Following are the tasks</p>
        <p>performed by the system analyst:</p>
        <p><strong>Defining Requirement: </strong>The basic step for any system analyst is to</p>
        <p>understand the requirements of the users. This is achieved by</p>
        <p>various fact finding techniques like interviewing, observation,</p>
        <p>questionnaire etc. The information should be collected in such a</p>
        <p>way that it will be useful to develop such a system which can</p>
        <p>provide additional features to the users apart from the desired.</p>
        <p><strong>Prioritizing Requirements</strong>: Number of users uses the system in the</p>
        <p>organization. Each one has a different requirement and</p>
        <p>retrieves different information. Due to certain limitations in</p>
        <p>computing capacity it may not be possible to satisfy the needs of all the</p>
        <p>users. Even if the computer capacity is good enough is it</p>
        <p>necessary to take some tasks and update the tasks as per the</p>
        <p>changing requirements. Hence it is important to create list of</p>
        <p>priorities according to users requirements. The best way to</p>
        <p>overcome the above limitations is to have a common formal or</p>
        <p>informal discussion with the users of the system. This helps the</p>
        <p>system analyst to arrive at a better conclusion.</p>
        <p><strong>Gathering Facts, data and opinions of Users: </strong>After determining the</p>
        <p>necessary needs and collecting useful information the analyst starts</p>
        <p>the development of the system with active cooperation from the users</p>
        <p>of the system. Time to time, the users update the analyst with the</p>
        <p>necessary information for developing the system. The analyst</p>
        <p>while developing the system continuously consults the users and</p>
        <p>acquires their views and opinions.</p>
        <p><strong>Evaluation and Analysis: </strong>As the analyst maintains continuous he</p>
        <p>constantly changes and modifies the system to make it better and</p>
        <p>more user friendly for the users.</p>
        <p><strong>Solving Problems: </strong>The analyst must provide alternate solutions to the</p>
        <p>management and should a in dept study of the system to avoid future</p>
        <p>problems. The analyst should provide with some flexible</p>
        <p>alternatives to the management which will help the manager to pick the</p>
        <p>system which provides the best solution.</p>
        <p><strong>Drawing </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Specifications: </strong></p>
        <p>The analyst</p>
        <p>must draw certain</p>
        <p>specifications which will be useful for the manager. The analyst</p>
        <p>should lay the specification which can be easily understood by the</p>
        <p>manager</p>
        <p>and they</p>
        <p>should be purely non-technical.</p>
        <p>The</p>
        <p>specifications must be in detailed and in well presented form.<strong>14 </strong></p>
        <p><strong> Attributes of System Analyst: </strong></p>
        <p>A System Analyst (S<em>A</em>) analyzes the organization and design</p>
        <p>of</p>
        <p>businesses,</p>
        <p>government</p>
        <p>departments,</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>non-profit</p>
        <p>organizations; they also assess business models and their</p>
        <p>integration with technology.</p>
        <p>There are at least four tiers of business analysis:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Planning Strategically - The analysis of the organization</li>
        </ol>
        <p>business strategic needs</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>Operating/Business model analysis - the definition and</li>
        </ol>
        <p>analysis of the organization's policies and market business</p>
        <p>approaches</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li>Process definition and design - the business process</li>
        </ol>
        <p>modeling (often developed through process modeling and</p>
        <p>design)</p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>IT/Technical business analysis - the interpretation of</li>
        </ol>
        <p>business rules and requirements for technical systems</p>
        <p>(generally IT)</p>
        <p>Within the systems development life cycle domain (SDLC),</p>
        <p>the business analyst typically performs a liaison function between the</p>
        <p>business side of an enterprise and the providers of services to the</p>
        <p>enterprise. A Common alternative role in the IT sector is</p>
        <p>business analyst, systems analyst, and functional analyst, although</p>
        <p>some organizations may differentiate between these titles and</p>
        <p>corresponding responsibilities.</p>
        <p><strong> Skill required for System Analyst: </strong></p>
        <p>Interpersonal skills are as follows:</p>
        <p><strong>1: Communication: </strong></p>
        <p>It is an interpersonal quality; the system analyst must have</p>
        <p>command on English language. Communication is necessary to</p>
        <p>establish a proper relationship between system analyst and the</p>
        <p>user.</p>
        <p>Communication is need to Gather correct information</p>
        <p>Establishes a problem solving ideas in front of the management.</p>
        <p><strong>2: Understanding: </strong></p>
        <p>This is also an interpersonal quality of the system analyst,</p>
        <p>understanding includes</p>
        <p>Understanding of the objectives of the organization.</p>
        <p>Understanding the problems of the system.<strong>15 </strong></p>
        <p>Understanding the information given by the user or employee of the</p>
        <p>organization.</p>
        <p><strong>3: Selling: </strong></p>
        <p>The ideas of the system analyst are his products which he sells to</p>
        <p>the manager of a particular organization. The system analyst must</p>
        <p>have not only the ability of creating ideas but also to sell his ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>4: Teaching: </strong></p>
        <p>It is also an interpersonal quality. A system analyst must</p>
        <p>have teaching skills. He must have the ability to teach team</p>
        <p>members and the users. H e has to teach about the new system</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>also</p>
        <p>about</p>
        <p>the proper</p>
        <p>use of the new</p>
        <p>system.</p>
        <p><strong>5: New technology: </strong></p>
        <p>An analyst is an agent of change, he or she must have the ability to</p>
        <p>show all the benefits of the candidate system with the new</p>
        <p>technological</p>
        <p>advancement,</p>
        <p>he</p>

        <p><strong>SUMMARY </strong></p>
        <p>This chapter is based on System, their entire factors and impact on</p>
        <p>surrounding. System is divided into different types and it performs</p>
        <p>various functions. System analyst can handle every types of</p>

        <p><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong><strong>17 </strong></p>
        <p><strong> INTRODUCTION: </strong></p>
        <p>SDLC<strong>, </strong>It is System Development Life Cycle. It includes</p>
        <p>Guidance, policies, and procedures for developing systems</p>
        <p>throughout their life cycle, including requirements, design,</p>
        <p>implementation, testing, deployment, operations, and maintenance.</p>
        <p><strong> THE SYSTEMS </strong></p>
        <p><strong>DEVELOPMENT </strong></p>
        <p><strong>LIFE CYCLE </strong></p>
        <p><strong>(SDLC), OR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE </strong></p>
        <p><strong>CYCLE </strong>:</p>
        <p>In systems engineering, information systems and software</p>
        <p>engineering, is the process of creating or altering systems, and the</p>
        <p>models and methodologies that people use to develop these</p>
        <p>systems. The concept generally refers to computer or information</p>
        <p>systems.</p>
        <p>Systems and Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process</p>
        <p>used by a systems analyst to develop an information system,</p>
        <p>including requirements, validation, training, and user (stakeholder)</p>
        <p>ownership. Any SDLC should result in a high quality system that</p>
        <p>meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion</p>
        <p>within time and cost estimates, works effectively and efficiently in the</p>
        <p>current and planned Information Technology infrastructure, and is</p>
        <p>inexpensive to maintain and cost-effective to enhance.</p>
        <p><strong>For ex. </strong>Computer systems are complex and often (especially with the</p>
        <p>recent rise of Service-Oriented Architecture) link multiple</p>
        <p>traditional systems potentially supplied by different software</p>
        <p>vendors. To manage this level of complexity, a number of SDLC</p>
        <p>models have been created: "waterfall"; "fountain"; "spiral"; "build</p>
        <p>and fix"; "rapid prototyping"; "incremental"; and "synchronize and</p>
        <p>stabilize.</p>
        <p>The systems development life cycle (SDLC) is a type of</p>
        <p>methodology used to describe the process for building information</p>
        <p>systems, intended to develop information systems in a very<strong>18 </strong></p>
        <p>deliberate, structured and methodical way, reiterating each stage of the</p>
        <p>life cycle.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2.1 System Development Phases: </strong></p>
        <p>Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) adheres to</p>
        <p>important phases that are essential for developers, such as</p>
        <p>planning, analysis,</p>
        <p>design,</p>
        <p>and implementation,</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>are</p>
        <p>explained in the section below. Several Systems Development Life</p>
        <p>Cycle Models exist, the oldest of which &mdash; originally regarded as</p>
        <p>"the Systems Development Life Cycle" &mdash; is the waterfall model: a</p>
        <p>sequence of stages in which the output of each stage becomes the</p>
        <p>input for the next. These stages generally follow the same basic</p>
        <p>steps, but many different waterfall methodologies give the steps</p>
        <p>different names and the number of steps seems to vary between</p>
        <p>four and seven.</p>

        <p>Implementation</p>
        <p><strong>2.2.3 Explanation of the SDLC Phases: </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Requirements gathering and analysis </strong></p>
        <p>The goal of system analysis is to determine where the</p>
        <p>problem is in an attempt to fix the system. This step involves</p>
        <p>"breaking down" the system in different pieces to analyze the</p>
        <p>situation, analyzing project goals, "breaking down" what needs to be</p>
        <p>created and attempting to engage users so that definite</p>
        <p>requirements can be defined (Decomposition computer science).</p>
        <p>Requirements Gathering sometimes requires individuals/teams<strong>19 </strong></p>
        <p>from client as well as service provider sides to get detailed and</p>
        <p>accurate requirements....</p>
        <p><strong>Design: </strong></p>
        <p>In systems, design functions and operations are described in</p>
        <p>detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams</p>
        <p>and other documentation. The output of this stage will describe the</p>
        <p>new system as a collection of modules or subsystems.</p>
        <p>The design stage takes as its initial input the requirements</p>
        <p>identified in the approved requirements document. For each</p>
        <p>requirement, a set of one or more design elements will be produced as</p>
        <p>a result of interviews, workshops, and/or prototype efforts.</p>
        <p>Design elements describe the desired software features in detail,</p>
        <p>and generally include functional hierarchy diagrams, screen layout</p>
        <p>diagrams, tables of business rules, business process diagrams,</p>
        <p>pseudocode, and a complete entity-relationship diagram with a full</p>
        <p>data dictionary. These design elements are intended to describe the</p>
        <p>software in sufficient detail that skilled programmers may</p>
        <p>develop the software with minimal additional input design.</p>
        <p><strong>Build or coding: </strong></p>
        <p>Modular and subsystem programming code will be</p>
        <p>accomplished during this stage. Unit testing and module testing are</p>
        <p>done in this stage by the developers. This stage is intermingled with the</p>
        <p>next in that individual modules will need testing before</p>
        <p>integration to the main project.</p>
        <p><strong>Testing: </strong></p>
        <p>The code is tested at various levels in software testing. Unit,</p>
        <p>system and user acceptance testings are often performed. This is a</p>
        <p>grey area as many different opinions exist as to what the stages of</p>
        <p>testing are and how much if any iteration occurs. Iteration is not</p>
        <p>generally part of the waterfall model, but usually some occur at this</p>
        <p>stage.</p>
        <p>Below are the following types of testing:</p>
        <p> Data set testing.</p>
        <p> Unit testing</p>
        <p> System testing</p>
        <p> Integration testing</p>
        <p> Black box testing</p>
        <p> White box testing</p>
        <p> Regression testing</p>
        <p> Automation testing</p>
        <p> User acceptance testing</p>
        <p> Performance testing</p>
        <p> Production<strong>20 </strong></p>
        <p>definition:- it is a process that ensures that the program performs the</p>
        <p>intended task.</p>
        <p><strong>Operations and maintenance </strong></p>
        <p>The deployment of the system includes changes and</p>
        <p>enhancements before the decommissioning or sunset of the</p>
        <p>system. Maintaining the system is an important aspect of SDLC. As</p>
        <p>key personnel change positions in the organization, new changes</p>
        <p>will be implemented, which will require system updates.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2.4 SDLC Phases with Management Control : </strong></p>
        <p>The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases serve as</p>
        <p>a programmatic guide to project activity and provide a flexible but</p>
        <p>consistent way to conduct projects to a depth matching the scope</p>
        <p>of the project. Each of the SDLC phase objectives are described</p>
        <p>in this section with key deliverables, a description of</p>
        <p>recommended tasks, and a summary of related control objectives for</p>
        <p>effective management. It is critical for the project manager to</p>
        <p>establish and monitor control objectives during each SDLC phase</p>
        <p>while executing projects. Control objectives help to provide a clear</p>
        <p>statement of the desired result or purpose and should be used</p>
        <p>throughout the entire SDLC process. Control objectives can be</p>
        <p>grouped into major categories (Domains), and relate to the SDLC</p>
        <p>phases as shown in the figure.</p>
        <p>To manage and control any SDLC initiative, each project will be</p>
        <p>required to establish some degree of a Work Breakdown</p>
        <p>Structure(WBS) to capture and schedule the work necessary to</p>
        <p>complete the project. The WBS and all programmatic material</p>
        <p>should be kept in the &ldquo;Project Description&rdquo; section of the project</p>
        <p>notebook. The WBS format is mostly left to the project manager to</p>
        <p>establish in a way that best describes the project work. There are</p>
        <p>some key areas that must be defined in the WBS as part of the</p>
        <p>SDLC policy. The following diagram describes three key areas that</p>
        <p>will be addressed in the WBS in a manner established by the</p>
        <p>project manager.<strong>21 </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Diagram: SDLC Phases Related to Management Controls </strong></p>
        <p><strong>2.2.5 Advantages of SDLC model: </strong></p>
        <p>With an SDLC Model, developers will have a clear idea on</p>
        <p>what should be or shouldn&rsquo;t be built. Since they already have an</p>
        <p>idea on the problems that should be answered, a detailed plan</p>
        <p>could be created following a certain SDLC model. With an SDLC</p>
        <p>model, developers could even create a program that will answer</p>
        <p>different problems at the same time. Since everything will be laid</p>
        <p>out before a single code is written, the goal is clear and could be</p>
        <p>implemented on time. Although there is a great possibility of</p>
        <p>deviation from the plan, a good project manager will take care of</p>
        <p>that concern.</p>
        <p>With an SDLC Model, programs built will have a clear</p>
        <p>documentation of development, structure and even coding. In case</p>
        <p>there are problems once the program is adopted for public use,</p>
        <p>developers will always have the documentation to refer to when</p>
        <p>they need to look for any loopholes. Instead of testing it over and</p>
        <p>over again which will stop the implementation for a while,</p>
        <p>developers will just look at the documentation and perform proper</p>
        <p>maintenance program. This means SDLC will breathe more life to the</p>
        <p>program. Instead of frustrating developers in uesswork if</p>
        <p>something goes wrong, SDLC will make sure everything goes</p>
        <p>smoothly. It will also be a tool for maintenance, ensuring the</p>
        <p>program created will last for a long time.<strong>22 </strong></p>
        <p><strong>2.2.6 Disadvantages of SDLC Model: </strong></p>
        <p>Thinking about the disadvantages of a SDLC model is like</p>
        <p>looking for a needle in the haystack. But the closest disadvantage</p>
        <p>anyone could think of SDLC is the difference between what is</p>
        <p>written in paper and what is actually implemented. There are things</p>
        <p>that are happening in the actual work that the paper doesn&rsquo;t see.</p>
        <p>This gives a good impression for the clients especially for 3rd party</p>
        <p>developers but when the software is actually launched it&rsquo;s on a very</p>
        <p>bad situation. The actual situation of software development could be</p>
        <p>covered by fancy paperwork of SDLC.</p>
        <p>Another disadvantage of a program or software that follows</p>
        <p>the SDLC program is it encourages stiff implementation instead of</p>
        <p>pushing for creativity in different oftware. Although there are SDLC</p>
        <p>models where programmers could apply their creative juices, it&rsquo;s</p>
        <p>always in the realm of what is needed instead of freely</p>
        <p>implementing what the developers think of necessary in the present</p>
        <p>environment.</p>
        <p>There are so many things that could be done by</p>
        <p>developers if there are no boundaries or limitations in what should be</p>
        <p>developed.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3 </strong></p>
        <p><strong>WORK </strong></p>
        <p><strong>BREAKDOWN </strong></p>
        <p><strong>STRUCTURE </strong></p>
        <p><strong>ORGANIZATION: </strong></p>
        <p>The upper section of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</p>
        <p>should identify the major phases and milestones of the project in a</p>
        <p>summary fashion. In addition, the upper section should provide an</p>
        <p>overview of the full scope and timeline of the project and will be part of</p>
        <p>the initial project description effort leading to project approval. The</p>
        <p>middle section of the WBS is based on the seven Systems</p>
        <p>Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases as a guide for WBS task</p>
        <p>development. The WBS elements should consist of milestones and</p>
        <p>&ldquo;tasks&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;activities&rdquo; and have a definitive period</p>
        <p>(usually two weeks or more). Each task must have a measurable</p>
        <p>output (e.g. document, decision, or analysis). A WBS task may rely on</p>
        <p>one or more activities (e.g. software engineering, systems</p>
        <p>engineering) and may require close coordination with other tasks,</p>
        <p>either internal or external to the project. Any part of the project</p>
        <p>needing support from contractors should have a Statement of</p>
        <p>work (SOW) written to include the appropriate tasks from the SDLC</p>
        <p>phases.<strong>23 </strong></p>

        <p><strong>2.4 ITERATIVE AND INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT </strong></p>
        <p><strong>MODEL: </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iterative and Incremental development </strong>is at the heart of a</p>
        <p>cyclic software development process developed in response to the</p>
        <p>weaknesses of the waterfall model. It starts with an initial planning</p>
        <p>and ends with deployment with the cyclic interactions in between.</p>
        <p>Iterative and incremental development is essential parts of the</p>
        <p>Rational Unified Process, Extreme Programming and generally the</p>

        <p><strong>2.4.1 Iterative/Incremental Development </strong></p>
        <p>Incremental development slices the system functionality into</p>
        <p>increments (portions). In each increment, a slice of functionality is</p>
        <p>delivered through cross-discipline work, from the requirements to the</p>
        <p>deployment. The unified process groups increments/iterations into</p>
        <p>phases: inception, elaboration, construction, and transition.</p>
        <p> Inception identifies project scope, risks, and requirements</p>
        <p>(functional and non-functional) at a high level but in enough</p>
        <p>detail that work can be estimated.</p>
        <p> Elaboration delivers a working architecture that mitigates the top</p>
        <p>risks and fulfills the non-functional requirements.</p>
        <p> Construction</p>
        <p>incrementally</p>
        <p>fills-in</p>
        <p>the</p>
        <p>architecture</p>
        <p>with</p>
        <p>production-ready code produced from</p>
        <p>analysis,</p>
        <p>design,</p>
        <p>implementation, and testing of the functional requirements.</p>
        <p> Transition delivers the system into the production operating</p>

        <p><strong>2.5 EXTREME PROGRAMMING: </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Extreme </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Programming </strong></p>
        <p><strong>(XP) </strong>is</p>
        <p>a software</p>
        <p>development</p>
        <p>methodology which is intended to improve software quality and</p>
        <p>responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of</p>
        <p>agile software development, it advocates frequent "releases" in</p>
        <p>short development cycles (time boxing), which is intended to</p>
        <p>improve productivity and introduce checkpoints where new</p>
        <p>customer requirements can be adopted.</p>
        <p><strong>Rules for Extreme Programming: </strong></p>
        <p>! Planning</p>
        <p>! Managing</p>
        <p>!</p>
        <p>Coding</p>

        <p><strong>2.5.1 Goals of Extreme Programming Model: </strong></p>
        <p>Extreme</p>
        <p>Programming</p>
        <p>Explained describes</p>
        <p>Extreme</p>
        <p>Programming as a software development discipline that organizes</p>
        <p>people to produce higher quality software more productively.</p>
        <p>In</p>
        <p>traditional</p>
        <p>system</p>
        <p>development</p>
        <p>methods</p>
        <p>(such</p>
        <p>as SSADM or the waterfall model) the requirements for the system</p>
        <p>are determined at the beginning of the development project and<strong>26 </strong></p>
        <p>the requirements at a later stage (a common feature of software</p>
        <p>engineering projects) will be high. Like other agile software</p>
        <p>development methods, XP attempts to reduce the cost of change by</p>
        <p>having multiple short development cycles, rather than one long one.</p>
        <p>In this doctrine changes are a natural, inescapable and</p>
        <p>desirable aspect of software development projects, and should be</p>
        <p>planned for instead of attempting to define a stable set of</p>
        <p>requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>2.6 RAD MODEL: </strong></p>
        <p>It is Rapid Application development model. Rapid Application</p>
        <p>Development (RAD) refers to a type of software development</p>
        <p>methodology that uses minimal planning in favour of rapid</p>
        <p>prototyping. The "planning" of software developed using RAD is</p>
        <p>interleaved with writing the software itself. The lack of extensive</p>
        <p>pre-planning generally allows software to be written much faster,</p>
        <p>and makes it easier to change requirements.</p>
        <p>Rapid Application Development is a software development</p>
        <p>methodology that</p>
        <p>involves</p>
        <p>techniques</p>
        <p>like</p>
        <p>iterative</p>
        <p>development and software</p>
        <p>prototyping.</p>
        <p>According to Whitten</p>
        <p>(2004), it is a merger of various structured techniques, especially</p>
        <p>data-driven Information Engineering, with prototyping techniques to</p>
        <p>accelerate software systems development.</p>
        <p><strong>2.6.1 Practical Application of RAD Model</strong>:</p>
        <p>When</p>
        <p>organizations</p>
        <p>adopt</p>
        <p>rapid</p>
        <p>development</p>
        <p>methodologies, care must be taken to avoid role and responsibility</p>
        <p>confusion and communication breakdown within the development</p>
        <p>team, and between the team and the client. In addition, especially in</p>
        <p>cases where the client is absent or not able to participate with</p>
        <p>authority in the development process, the system analyst should be</p>
        <p>endowed with this authority on behalf of the client to ensure</p>
        <p>appropriate</p>
        <p>prioritisation</p>
        <p>of</p>
        <p>non-functional</p>
        <p>requirements.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, no increment of the system should be developed</p>
        <p>without a thorough and formally documented design phase.</p>
        <p><strong>2.6.2 Advantages of the RAD methodology: </strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Flexible and adaptable to changes.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>which to judge whether critical system requirements are being</p>
        <p>met by the system. Report output can be compared with</p>
        <p>existing reports. Data entry forms can be reviewed for</p>
        <p>completeness of all fields, navigation, data access (drop down</p>
        <p>lists, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.).<strong>27 </strong></p>

        <p><strong> UNIFIED PROCESS MODEL: </strong></p>
        <p>The Unified</p>
        <p>Software</p>
        <p>Development</p>
        <p>Process or Unified</p>
        <p>Process is</p>
        <p>a</p>
        <p>popular iterative</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>incremental software</p>
        <p>development process framework. The best-known and extensively</p>
        <p>documented refinement of the Unified Process is the Rational</p>
        <p>Unified Process (RUP).</p>
        <p><strong>Diagram: </strong>Profile of a typical project showing the relative sizes of</p>
        <p>the four phases of the Unified Process</p>
        <p>The Unified Process is not simply a process, but rather an</p>
        <p>extensible framework which should be customized for specific</p>
        <p>organizations or projects. The Rational Unified Process is, similarly, a</p>
        <p>customizable framework. As a result it is often impossible to say</p>
        <p>whether a refinement of the process was derived from UP or from</p>
        <p>RUP, and so the names tend to be used interchangeably.<strong>28 </strong></p>
        <p><strong>2.7.1 Characteristics: </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iterative and Incremental </strong></p>
        <p>The Unified Process is an iterative and incremental</p>
        <p>development process. The Elaboration, Construction and Transition</p>
        <p>phases are divided into a series of time boxed iterations. (The</p>
        <p>Inception phase may also be divided into iterations for a large</p>
        <p>project.) Each iteration results in an increment, which is a release of the</p>
        <p>system that contains added or improved functionality compared with</p>
        <p>the previous release.</p>
        <p>Although most iterations will include work in most of the</p>
        <p>process disciplines (e.g. Requirements, Design, Implementation,</p>
        <p>Testing) the relative effort and emphasis will change over the</p>
        <p>course of the project.</p>
        <p><strong>2.8 USE CASE DRIVEN </strong></p>
        <p>In the Unified Process, use cases are used to capture the</p>
        <p>functional requirements and to define the contents of the iterations.</p>
        <p>Each iteration takes a set of use cases or scenarios from</p>
        <p>requirements all the way through implementation, test and</p>
        <p>deployment.</p>
        <p><strong>2.8.1 Architecture Centric: </strong></p>
        <p>The Unified Process insists that architecture sit at the heart of</p>
        <p>the project team's efforts to shape the system. Since no single</p>
        <p>model is sufficient to cover all aspects of a system, the Unified</p>
        <p>Process supports multiple architectural models and views.</p>
        <p>One of the most important deliverables of the process is</p>
        <p>the executable architecture baseline which is created during the</p>
        <p>Elaboration phase. This partial implementation of the system</p>
        <p>serves to validate the architecture and act as a foundation for</p>
        <p>remaining development.</p>
        <p><strong>2.8.2 Risk Focused: </strong></p>
        <p>The Unified Process requires the project team to focus on</p>
        <p>addressing the most critical risks early in the project life cycle. The</p>
        <p>deliverables of each iteration, especially in the Elaboration phase,</p>
        <p>must b e selected in order to ensure that the greatest risks are</p>
        <p>addressed first.<strong>29 </strong></p>
        <p>The Unified Process divides the project into four phases:</p>
        <p> Inception</p>
        <p> Elaboration</p>
        <p> Construction</p>
        <p> Transition</p>
        <p><strong>2.8.3 Inception Phase: </strong></p>
        <p>Inception is the smallest phase in the project, and ideally it</p>
        <p>should be quite short. If the Inception Phase is long then it may be an</p>
        <p>indication of excessive up-front specification, which is contrary to the</p>
        <p>spirit of the Unified Process.</p>
        <p>The following are typical goals for the Inception phase.</p>
        <p> Establish a justification or business case for the project</p>
        <p> Establish the project scope and boundary conditions</p>
        <p> Outline the use cases and key requirements that will drive the</p>
        <p>design tradeoffs</p>
        <p> Outline one or more candidate architectures</p>
        <p> Identify risks</p>
        <p> Prepare a preliminary project schedule and cost estimate</p>
        <p>The Lifecycle Objective Milestone marks the end of the</p>
        <p>Inception phase.</p>
        <p><strong>2.8.4 Elaboration Phase: </strong></p>
        <p>During the Elaboration phase the project team is expected to</p>
        <p>capture a healthy majority of the system requirements. However, the</p>
        <p>primary goals of Elaboration are to address known risk factors and to</p>
        <p>establish and validate the system architecture. Common processes</p>
        <p>undertaken in this phase include the creation of use case</p>
        <p>diagrams, conceptual diagrams (class diagrams with only basic</p>
        <p>notation) and package diagrams (architectural diagrams).</p>
        <p>The architecture</p>
        <p>is validated</p>
        <p>primarily</p>
        <p>through</p>
        <p>the</p>
        <p>implementation of an Executable Architecture Baseline. This is a</p>
        <p>partial implementation of the system which includes the core, most</p>
        <p>architecturally significant, components. It is built in a series of small,</p>
        <p>timeboxed iterations. By the end of the Elaboration phase the</p>
        <p>system architecture must have stabilized and the executable</p>
        <p>architecture baseline must demonstrate that the architecture will</p>
        <p>support the key system functionality and exhibit the right behavior in</p>
        <p>terms of performance, scalability and cost.<strong>30 </strong></p>
        <p>The final Elaboration phase deliverable is a plan (including</p>
        <p>cost and schedule estimates) for the Construction phase. At this</p>
        <p>point the plan should be accurate and credible, since it should be</p>
        <p>based on the Elaboration phase experience and since significant</p>
        <p>risk factors should have been addressed during the Elaboration</p>
        <p>phase.</p>
        <p>The Lifecycle Architecture Milestone marks the end of the</p>
        <p>Elaboration phase.</p>
        <p><strong>2.8.5 Construction Phase: </strong></p>
        <p>Construction is the largest phase in the project. In this phase</p>
        <p>the remainder of the system is built on the foundation laid in</p>
        <p>Elaboration. System features are implemented in a series of short,</p>
        <p>time boxed iterations. Each iteration results in an executable</p>
        <p>release of the software. It is customary to write full text use cases</p>
        <p>during the construction phase and each one becomes the start of a</p>
        <p>new iteration. Common UML (Unified Modelling Language)</p>
        <p>diagrams used during this phase include Activity, Sequence,</p>
        <p>Collaboration,</p>
        <p>State</p>
        <p>(Transition)</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>Interaction</p>
        <p>Overview</p>
        <p>diagrams.</p>
        <p>The Initial Operational Capability Milestone marks the end of</p>
        <p>the Construction phase.</p>
        <p><strong>2.8.6 Transition Phase </strong></p>
        <p>The final project phase is Transition. In this phase the</p>
        <p>system is deployed to the target users. Feedback received from an</p>
        <p>initial release (or initial releases) may result in further refinements to</p>
        <p>be incorporated over the course of several Transition phase</p>
        <p>iterations. The Transition phase also includes system conversions</p>
        <p>and user training.</p>
        <p><strong>2.9 EVOLUTIONARY SOFTWARE PROCESS MODEL: </strong></p>
        <p>Software Products can be perceived as evolving over a time</p>
        <p>period.</p>
        <p>However,</p>
        <p>neither</p>
        <p>the Linear</p>
        <p>Sequential</p>
        <p>Model nor</p>
        <p>the Prototype Model applies this aspect to software production.</p>
        <p>The Linear Sequential Model was designed for straight-line</p>
        <p>development. The Prototype Model was designed to assist the</p>
        <p>customer in understanding requirements and is designed to</p>
        <p>produce a visualization of the final system.</p>
        <p>But the Evolutionary Models take the concept of &ldquo;evolution&rdquo;</p>
        <p>into</p>
        <p>the</p>
        <p>engineering</p>
        <p>paradigm.</p>
        <p>Therefore</p>
        <p>Evolutionary</p>
        <p>Models are <strong>iterative. </strong>They are built in a manner that enables</p>
        <p>software engineers to develop increasingly more complex versions of</p>
        <p>the software.<strong>31 </strong></p>
        <p><strong>2.9.1 The Incremental Model: </strong></p>
        <p>The Incremental Model combines elements of the Linear</p>
        <p>Sequential Model (applied repetitively) with the iterative philosophy of</p>
        <p>prototyping. When an Incremental Model is used, the first</p>
        <p>increment is often the &ldquo;core product&rdquo;. The subsequent iterations are the</p>
        <p>supporting functionalities or the add-on features that a customer would</p>
        <p>like to see. More specifically, the model is designed,</p>
        <p>implemented and tested as a series of incremental builds until the</p>
        <p>product is finished.</p>
        <p><strong>2.10 THE SPIRAL MODEL: </strong></p>
        <p>The Spiral</p>
        <p>Model is</p>
        <p>an evolutionary</p>
        <p>software</p>
        <p>process</p>
        <p>model that couples the iterative nature of prototyping with the</p>
        <p>controlled and systematic aspects of the Linear Sequential Model.</p>
        <p>Using the Spiral Model the software is developed in a series of</p>
        <p>incremental releases. Unlike the Iteration Model where in the first</p>
        <p>product is a core product, in the Spiral Model the early iterations</p>
        <p>could result in a paper model or a prototype. However, during later</p>
        <p>iterations more complex functionalities could be added.</p>
        <p>A Spiral</p>
        <p>Model,</p>
        <p>combines</p>
        <p>the iterative</p>
        <p>nature</p>
        <p>of</p>
        <p>prototyping with the controlled and systematic aspects of the</p>
        <p>Waterfall Model, therein providing the potential for rapid</p>
        <p>development of incremental versions of the software. A Spiral</p>
        <p>Model is divided into a number of framework activities, also called</p>
        <p>task regions. These task regions could vary from 3-6 in number and</p>
        <p>they are:</p>
        <p>! <strong>Customer Communication </strong>- tasks required to establish</p>
        <p>effective communication between the developer and customer.</p>
        <p>! <strong>Planning </strong>- tasks required defining resources, timelines and</p>
        <p>other project related information /items.</p>
        <p>! <strong>Risk Analysis </strong>- tasks required to assess the technical and</p>
        <p>management risks.</p>
        <p>! <strong>Engineering </strong>- tasks required to build one or more</p>
        <p>representation of the application.</p>
        <p>! <strong>Construction &amp; Release </strong>- tasks required to construct, test and</p>
        <p>support (eg. Documentation and training)</p>
        <p>! <strong>Customer evaluation </strong>- tasks required to obtain periodic</p>
        <p>customer feedback so that there are no last minute surprises.<strong>32 </strong></p>
        <p><strong>2.10.1 Advantages of the Spiral Model: </strong></p>
        <p>! Realistic approach to the development because the software</p>
        <p>evolves as the process progresses. In addition, the developer</p>
        <p>and the client better understand and react to risks at each</p>
        <p>evolutionary level.</p>
        <p>! The model uses prototyping as a risk reduction mechanism and</p>
        <p>allows for the development of prototypes at any stage of the</p>
        <p>evolutionary development.</p>
        <p>! It maintains a systematic stepwise approach, like the classic</p>
        <p>waterfall model, and also incorporates into it an iterative</p>
        <p>framework that more reflect the real world.</p>
        <p><strong>2.10.2 Disadvantages of the Spiral Model: </strong></p>
        <p>! One should possess considerable risk-assessment expertise</p>
        <p>! It has not been employed as much proven models (e.g.</p>
        <p>the Waterfall Model) and hence may prove difficult to &lsquo;sell&rsquo; to the</p>
        <p>client.</p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;CONCURRENT DEVELOPMENT MODEL: </strong></p>
        <p>The concurrent development model, sometimes called</p>
        <p>concurrent engineering.</p>
        <p>The concurrent process model can be represented</p>
        <p>schematically as a series of major technical activities, tasks, and</p>
        <p>their associated states. For example, the engineering activity</p>
        <p>defined for the spiral model is accomplished by invoking the</p>
        <p>following tasks: prototyping and/or analysis modeling, requirements</p>
        <p>specification, and design.</p>
        <p>The activity-analysis-may be in any one of the states noted at</p>
        <p>any given time. Similarly, other activities (e.g., design or</p>
        <p>customer communication) can be represented in an analogous</p>
        <p>manner. All activities exist concurrently but reside in different</p>
        <p>states. For example, early in a project the customer communication</p>
        <p>activity has completed its first iteration and exists in the awaiting</p>
        <p>changes state. The analysis activity (which existed in the none</p>
        <p>state while initial customer communication was completed) now</p>
        <p>makes a transition into the under development state. If, however, the</p>
        <p>customer indicates that changes in requirements must be made,</p>
        <p>the analysis activity moves from the under development state into</p>
        <p>the awaiting changes state.</p>
