        <p><b><h2>DIGITAL-TO-DIGITAL CONVERSION</h2></b></p>
        <p>Digital-to-digital encoding is the representation of digital information by a digital signal. When binary 1s and 0s generated by the computer are translated into a sequence of voltage pulses that can be propagated over a wire, this process is known as digital-to-digital encoding.</p>
        <p>Digital-to-digital encoding is divided into three categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unipolar Encoding</li>
          <li>Polar Encoding</li>
          <li>Bipolar Encoding</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Unipolar</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Digital transmission system sends the volltage pulses over the medium link such as wire or cable.</li>
          <li>In most types of encoding, one voltage level represents 0, and another voltage level represents 1.</li>
          <li>The polarity of each pulse determines whether it is positive or negative.</li>
          <li>This type of encoding is known as Unipolar encoding as it uses only one polarity.</li>
          <li>In Unipolar encoding, the polarity is assigned to the 1 binary state.</li>
          <li>In this, 1s are represented as a positive value and 0s are represented as a zero value.</li>
          <li>In Unipolar Encoding, '1' is considered as a high voltage and '0' is considered as a zero voltage.</li>
          <li>Unipolar encoding is simpler and inexpensive to implement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Polar</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Polar encoding is an encoding scheme that uses two voltage levels: one is positive, and another is negative.</li>
          <li>By using two voltage levels, an average voltage level is reduced, and the DC component problem of unipolar encoding scheme is alleviated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>NRZ</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>NRZ stands for Non-return zero.</li>
          <li>In NRZ encoding, the level of the signal can be represented either positive or negative.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The two most common methods used in NRZ are:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>NRZ-L:</strong>&nbsp;In NRZ-L encoding, the level of the signal depends on the type of the bit that it represents. If a bit is 0 or 1, then their voltages will be positive and negative respectively. Therefore, we can say that the level of the signal is dependent on the state of the bit.</p>
        <p><strong>NRZ-I:</strong>&nbsp;NRZ-I is an inversion of the voltage level that represents 1 bit. In the NRZ-I encoding scheme, a transition occurs between the positive and negative voltage that represents 1 bit. In this scheme, 0 bit represents no change and 1 bit represents a change in voltage level.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>RZ</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>RZ stands for Return to zero.</li>
          <li>There must be a signal change for each bit to achieve synchronization. However, to change with every bit, we need to have three values: positive, negative and zero.</li>
          <li>RZ is an encoding scheme that provides three values, positive voltage represents 1, the negative voltage represents 0, and zero voltage represents none.</li>
          <li>In the RZ scheme, halfway through each interval, the signal returns to zero.</li>
          <li>In RZ scheme, 1 bit is represented by positive-to-zero and 0 bit is represented by negative-to-zero.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Disadvantage of RZ:</strong></p>
        <p>It performs two signal changes to encode one bit that acquires more bandwidth.</p>
        <h3>Biphase</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Biphase is an encoding scheme in which signal changes at the middle of the bit interval but does not return to zero.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Biphase encoding is implemented in two different ways:</p>
        <p><strong>Manchester</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>It changes the signal at the middle of the bit interval but does not return to zero for synchronization.</li>
          <li>In Manchester encoding, a negative-to-positive transition represents binary 1, and positive-to-negative transition represents 0.</li>
          <li>Manchester has the same level of synchronization as RZ scheme except that it has two levels of amplitude.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Differential Manchester</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>It changes the signal at the middle of the bit interval for synchronization, but the presence or absence of the transition at the beginning of the interval determines the bit. A transition means binary 0 and no transition means binary 1.</li>
          <li>In Manchester Encoding scheme, two signal changes represent 0 and one signal change represent 1.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Bipolar</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bipolar encoding scheme represents three voltage levels: positive, negative, and zero.</li>
          <li>In Bipolar encoding scheme, zero level represents binary 0, and binary 1 is represented by alternating positive and negative voltages.</li>
          <li>If the first 1 bit is represented by positive amplitude, then the second 1 bit is represented by negative voltage, third 1 bit is represented by the positive amplitude and so on. This alternation can also occur even when the 1bits are not consecutive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Bipolar can be classified as:</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>AMI</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>AMI stands for&nbsp;<strong><em>alternate mark inversion</em></strong>where mark work comes from telegraphy which means 1. So, it can be redefined as&nbsp;<strong>alternate 1 inversion</strong>.</li>
          <li>In Bipolar AMI encoding scheme, 0 bit is represented by zero level and 1 bit is represented by alternating positive and negative voltages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Advantage:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>DC component is zero.</li>
          <li>Sequence of 1s bits are synchronized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>This encoding scheme does not ensure the synchronization of a long string of 0s bits.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>B8ZS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>B8ZS stands for&nbsp;<strong>Bipolar 8-Zero Substitution</strong>.</li>
          <li>This technique is adopted in North America to provide synchronization of a long sequence of 0s bits.</li>
          <li>In most of the cases, the functionality of B8ZS is similar to the bipolar AMI, but the only difference is that it provides the synchronization when a long sequence of 0s bits occur.</li>
          <li>B8ZS ensures synchronization of a long string of 0s by providing force artificial signal changes called violations, within 0 string pattern.</li>
          <li>When eight 0 occurs, then B8ZS implements some changes in 0s string pattern based on the polarity of the previous 1 bit.</li>
          <li>If the polarity of the previous 1 bit is positive, the eight 0s will be encoded as zero, zero, zero, positive, negative, zero, negative, positive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the polarity of previous 1 bit is negative, then the eight 0s will be encoded as zero, zero, zero, negative, positive, zero, positive, negative.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HDB3</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>HDB3 stands for&nbsp;<strong>High-Density Bipolar 3</strong>.</li>
          <li>HDB3 technique was first adopted in Europe and Japan.</li>
          <li>HDB3 technique is designed to provide the synchronization of a long sequence of 0s bits.</li>
          <li>In the HDB3 technique, the pattern of violation is based on the polarity of the previous bit.</li>
          <li>When four 0s occur, HDB3 looks at the number of 1s bits occurred since the last substitution.</li>
          <li>If the number of 1s bits is odd, then the violation is made on the fourth consecutive of 0. If the polarity of the previous bit is positive, then the violation is positive. If the polarity of the previous bit is negative, then the violation is negative.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>If the number of 1s bits since the last substitution is odd.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the number of 1s bits is even, then the violation is made on the place of the first and fourth consecutive 0s. If the polarity of the previous bit is positive, then violations are negative, and if the polarity of the previous bit is negative, then violations are positive.</p>
        <p><strong>If the number of 1s bits since the last substitution is even.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERSION</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When an analog signal is digitalized, this is called an analog-to-digital conversion.</li>
          <li>Suppose human sends a voice in the form of an analog signal, we need to digitalize the analog signal which is less prone to noise. It requires a reduction in the number of values in an analog message so that they can be represented in the digital stream.</li>
          <li>In analog-to-digital conversion, the information contained in a continuous wave form is converted in digital pulses.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Techniques for Analog-To-Digital Conversion</h3>
        <h3>PAM</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>PAM stands for&nbsp;<strong>pulse amplitude modulation</strong>.</li>
          <li>PAM is a technique used in analog-to-digital conversion.</li>
          <li>PAM technique takes an analog signal, samples it, and generates a series of digital pulses based on the result of sampling where sampling means measuring the amplitude of a signal at equal intervals.</li>
          <li>PAM technique is not useful in data communication as it translates the original wave form into pulses, but these pulses are not digital. To make them digital, PAM technique is modified to PCM technique.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When an analog signal is digitalized, that is known as analog-to-digital conversion.</p>
        <p>Consider a human address a voice in the structure of an analog signal. We require to digitalize the analog signal that is smaller inclined to noise. It needed a decrease in the several values in an analog message defined in the digital flow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In analog-to-digital conversion, the data involved in a constant waveform is modified into digital pulses.</p>
        <h2>Methods for Analog-To-Digital Conversion</h2>
        <p>The various methods for Analog-to-Digital conversion are as follows &minus;</p>
        <h3>PAM</h3>
        <p>The first phase in analog to digital conversion is known as PAM. PAM represents&nbsp;<strong>pulse amplitude modulation</strong>. This method creates an analog signal, samples it, and creates digital pulses sequences based on sampling. The sampling method used in PAM is more helpful to other manufacturing fields than data communication. PAM is the infrastructure of an essential analog-to-digital conversion method known as&nbsp;<strong>pulse code modulation (PCM)</strong>.</p>
        <p>In PAM, the initial signal is sampled at the same intervals, as display in the figure. PAM uses a method known as a sample and hold.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>PCM</h3>
        <p>PCM represents&nbsp;<strong>Pulse Code Modulation</strong>. PCM method can change the pulses generated by PAM to develop a completely digital signal. To manage this, PCM first measures the PAM pulses. Quantization is a technique of authorizing integral values in a particular area to sampled instances.</p>
        <p>The most common technique to change an analog signal to digital data is called pulse code modulation (PCM). A PCM encoder has the following three processes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sampling</li>
          <li>Quantization</li>
          <li>Encoding</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Low pass filter :</strong>&nbsp;The low pass filter eliminates the high frequency components present in the input analog signal to ensure that the input signal to sampler is free from the unwanted frequency components.This is done to avoid aliasing of the message signal.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Sampling &ndash;</strong>The first step in PCM is sampling. Sampling is a process of measuring the amplitude of a continuous-time signal at discrete instants, converting the continuous signal into a discrete signal.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Quantization &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;The result of sampling is a series of pulses with amplitude values between the maximum and minimum amplitudes of the signal. The set of amplitudes can be infinite with non-integral values between two limits. The following are the steps in Quantization:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>We assume that the signal has amplitudes between Vmax and Vmin</li>
          <li>We divide it into L zones each of height d where, d= (Vmax- Vmin)/ L</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The value at the top of each sample in the graph shows the actual amplitude.</li>
          <li>The normalized pulse amplitude modulation(PAM) value is calculated using the formula amplitude/d.</li>
          <li>After this we calculate the quantized value which the process selects from the middle of each zone.</li>
          <li>The Quantized error is given by the difference between quantized value and normalised PAM value.</li>
          <li>The Quantization code for each sample based on quantization levels at the left of the graph.</li>
          <li><strong>Encoding &ndash;</strong>The digitization of the analog signal is done by the encoder. After each sample is quantized and the number of bits per sample is decided, each sample can be changed to an n bit code. Encoding also minimizes the bandwidth used. &nbsp;Note that the number of bits for each sample is determined from the number of quantization levels. If the number of quantization levels is L, the number of bits is n bit = log 2 L.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1>Delta modulation</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>A delta modulation</strong>&nbsp;(DM or &Delta;-modulation) is an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter"><u>analog-to-digital</u></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter"><u>digital-to-analog signal</u></a>&nbsp;conversion technique used for transmission of voice information where quality is not of primary importance.&nbsp;Delta modulation transmits only one bit per sample. Here, the present sample value is compared with the previous sample value and this result whether the amplitude is increased or decreased is transmitted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Adaptive Delta Modulation</h2>
        <p>his is a type of delta modulation technique. In digital modulation, there is a problem in determining the step size, which may have an influence on the quality of the wave, which is produced as output. We require a larger step size in the steep slope of the modulating signal, and a small step size is required when the message has a small slope. This kind of detail is ignored in Delta Modulation techniques. So, we need to have control over the step size according to our requirements so that we are able to obtain the sample output in the required fashion. This is the main concept behind adaptive Delta Modulation.</p>
        <p><strong>Digital to Analog Conversion</strong></p>
        <p>Digital Signal &ndash;&nbsp;A digital signal is a signal that represents data as a sequence of discrete values; at any given time it can only take on one of a finite<strong>&nbsp;</strong>number of values.</p>
        <p>Analog Signal &ndash;&nbsp;An analog signal is any continuous signal for which the time varying feature of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity i.e., analogous to another time varying signal.</p>
        <p>The following techniques can be used for Digital to Analog Conversion:</p>
        <p><strong>Amplitude Shift keying</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Amplitude Shift Keying is a technique in which carrier signal is analog and data to be modulated is digital. The amplitude of analog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data. The binary signal when modulated gives a zero value when the binary data represents 0 while gives the carrier output when data is 1. The frequency and phase of the carrier signal remain constant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Advantages of amplitude shift Keying &ndash;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It can be used to transmit digital data over optical fiber.</li>
          <li>The receiver and transmitter have a simple design which also makes it comparatively inexpensive.</li>
          <li>It uses lesser bandwidth as compared to FSK thus it offers high bandwidth efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages of amplitude shift Keying &ndash;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is susceptible to noise interference and entire transmissions could be lost due to this.</li>
          <li>It has lower power efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>Frequency Shift keying &ndash;&nbsp;In this modulation the frequency of analog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The output of a frequency shift keying modulated wave is high in frequency for a binary high input and is low in frequency for a binary low input. The amplitude and phase of the carrier signal remain constant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages of frequency shift Keying &ndash;</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Frequency shift keying modulated signal can help avoid the noise problems beset by ASK.</li>
          <li>It has lower chances of an error.</li>
          <li>It provides high signal to noise ratio.</li>
          <li>The transmitter and receiver implementations are simple for low data rate application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of frequency shift Keying &ndash;</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>It uses larger bandwidth as compared to ASK thus it offers less bandwidth efficiency.</li>
          <li>It has lower power efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><strong> Phase Shift keying &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>In this modulation the phase of the analog carrier signal is modified to reflect binary data.The amplitude and frequency of the carrier signal remains constant.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages of phase shift Keying &ndash;</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is a more power efficient modulation technique as compared to ASK and FSK.</li>
          <li>It has lower chances of an error.</li>
          <li>It allows data to be carried along a communication signal much more efficiently as compared to FSK.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of phase shift Keying &ndash;</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>It offers low bandwidth efficiency.</li>
          <li>The detection and recovery algorithms of binary data is very complex.</li>
          <li>It is a non coherent reference signal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Analog to Analog Conversion &ndash;</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analog-to-analog conversion, or modulation, is the representation of analog information by an analog signal. It is a process by virtue of which a characteristic of carrier wave is varied according to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal. This modulation is generally needed when a&nbsp;<strong>bandpass channel&nbsp;</strong>is required. Bandpass is a range of frequencies which are transmitted through a bandpass filter which is a filter allowing specific frequencies to pass preventing signals at unwanted frequencies.</li>
          <li>Analog to Analog conversion can be done in three ways:</li>
          <li>Amplitude Modulation</li>
          <li>Frequency Modulation</li>
          <li>Phase Modulation</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> AMPLITUDE MODULATION:</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The modulation in which the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied according to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal keeping phase and frequency as constant. The figure below shows the concept of amplitude modulation:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>AM is normally implemented by using a simple multiplier because the amplitude of the carrier signal needs to be changed according to the amplitude of the modulating signal.</p>
        <p><strong>AM bandwidth:</strong><br />The modulation creates a bandwidth that is twice the bandwidth of the modulating signal and covers a range centered on the carrier frequency.</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong> FREQUENCY MODULATION &ndash;</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The modulation in which the frequency of the carrier wave is varied according to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal keeping phase and amplitude as constant. The figure below shows the concept of frequency modulation:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>FM is normally implemented by using a voltage-controlled oscillator as with FSK. The frequency of the oscillator changes according to the input voltage which is the amplitude of the modulating signal.</p>
        <p><strong>FM bandwidth:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>The bandwidth of a frequency modulated signal varies with both deviation and modulating frequency.<br />If modulating frequency (Mf) 0.5, wide band Fm signal.</li>
          <li>For a narrow band Fm signal, bandwidth required is twice the maximum frequency of the modulation, however for a wide band Fm signal the required bandwidth can be very much larger, with detectable sidebands spreading out over large amounts of the frequency spectrum.</li>
          <li><strong> PHASE MODULATION:</strong><br />The modulation in which the phase of the carrier wave is varied according to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal keeping amplitude and frequency as constant. The figure below shows the concept of frequency modulation:</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Phase modulation is practically similar to Frequency Modulation, but in Phase modulation frequency of the carrier signal is not increased. It is normally implemented by using a voltage-controlled oscillator along with a derivative. The frequency of the oscillator changes according to the derivative of the input voltage which is the amplitude of the modulating signal.</p>
        <p><strong>Digital data transmission</strong></p>
        <p>There are two methods used for transferring data between computers which are given below: Serial Transmission and Parallel Transmission.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Serial Transmission:</strong>&nbsp;<br />In Serial Transmission, data-bit flows from one computer to another computer in bi-direction. In this transmission, one bit flows at one clock pulse. In Serial Transmission, 8 bits are transferred at a time having a start and stop bit.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Parallel Transmission:</strong>&nbsp;<br />In Parallel Transmission, many bits are flow together simultaneously from one computer to another computer. Parallel Transmission is faster than serial transmission to transmit the bits. Parallel transmission is used for short distance.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1><strong>DTE and DCE Interface</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) :</strong>It includes any unit that functions either as a source of or as a destination for binary digital data. At&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/"><u>physical layer</u></a>, it can be a terminal, microcomputer, computer, printer, fax, machine or any other device that generates or consumes digital data. DTEs do not often communicate information but need an intermediary to be able to communicate.&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong> Data Circuit Terminating Equipment (DCE) :</strong>It includes any functional unit that transmit or receives data in form of an analog or digital signal through a network. At physical layer, a DCE takes data generated by a DTE, converts them to an appropriate signal, and then introduces signal onto telecommunication link. Commonly used DCEs at this layer include modems. In any network, a DTE generates digital data and passes them to a DCE. DCE converts that data to a form acceptable to transmission medium and sends converted signal to another DCE on network. The second DCE takes signal off line, converts it to a form usable by its DTE, and delivers it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How they work</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>DTE generates or receives data: The DTE, which can be a computer, modem, or other device, generates or receives data that needs to be transmitted over a network.</li>
          <li>DTE converts data to serial format: Before the data can be transmitted over a network, the DTE converts it to a serial format. This means that the data is transmitted one bit at a time, rather than in parallel.</li>
          <li>DTE sends data to DCE: The DTE sends the serial data to the DCE, which provides the interface between the DTE and the network.</li>
          <li>DCE manages physical connection: The DCE is responsible for managing the physical connection between the DTE and the network. This includes tasks such as encoding and decoding the data, checking for errors, and controlling the flow of data.</li>
          <li>DCE transmits data: Once the DCE has received the data from the DTE, it transmits it over the network using the appropriate protocol.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Modem</strong></p>
        <p>A modem is a network device that both modulates and demodulates analog carrier signals (called sine waves) for encoding and decoding digital information for processing. Modems accomplish both of these tasks simultaneously and, for this reason, the term modem is a combination of &ldquo;modulate&rdquo; and &ldquo;demodulate.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The most common use for modems is for both sending and receiving of the digital information between personal computers. This information used to be transmitted over telephone lines using V.92, the last dial-up standard, to an analog modem that would convert the signal back to a digital format for a computer to read.</p>
        <p>Now, access to the Internet more commonly takes place using high-speed broadband modems</p>
        <h1>Cable modem</h1>
        <p>A&nbsp;<strong><em>hardware component</em></strong>&nbsp;known as a&nbsp;<strong><em>cable modem</em></strong>&nbsp;enables your computer to connect via a landline to an&nbsp;<strong><em>Internet service provider (ISP)</em></strong>. A cable modem is among the most popular access to broadband Internet, and it transforms an&nbsp;<strong><em>analogue signal</em></strong>&nbsp;into a&nbsp;<strong><em>digital signal</em></strong>. An&nbsp;<strong><em>Ethernet cord (Cat 5)</em></strong>&nbsp;is used to connect a cable modem to a computer or network router after first attaching a coaxial cable to the modem. Your Internet connection is shared by several computers due to the network routers. The latest cable modems may be equipped with a router with the option to share the connection through Wi-Fi. A stand-alone Motorola cable modem is seen in the image. However, there are also all-in-one modems that combine a modem and router into a single unit. Your modem is a stand-alone modem if it just has one coaxial cable connection and one Cat 5 connection, which means you'll need a router to share the connection.</p>
        <p>Purpose Does a Cable Modem Serve</p>
        <p>For internet and data communications systems to function, business cable modems are a crucial piece of infrastructure. Finding a device with the appropriate features is essential to enabling complete communication capabilities, including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Getting to the ISP:</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>A cable modem's ability to connect to your ISP's network is its most fundamental function, given that it relies on a well-established network of physical wires that span the entire nation, and it is one of the most common types of widely used and dependable forms of ISP connectivity.</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong> Utilizing and combining services:</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Using cable modem-based delivery networks, voice services, internet access, and television can all be combined into a single contract. Multiple services from one source can frequently lower your provider costs and result in cost savings for your company. Each service is delivered through distinct physical cable lines when they are combined, reducing service lag and interruptions. Bundling is similar to best practices for&nbsp;<strong><em>unified communications as a service (UCaaS)</em></strong>, which frequently group together comparable infrastructure and telecoms technology under a single platform.</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><strong> An increase in internet speed</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Less than&nbsp;<strong><em>100 Mbps</em></strong>&nbsp;and as much as a gigabit, ISPs and cable companies provide a variety of internet download servicing speeds. Your cable modem greatly impacts the speed of the internet you can access. Your company can see slower internet speeds if there is no&nbsp;<strong><em>DOCSIS model</em></strong>&nbsp;with a comparable speed specification.</p>
        <h1><strong><br /></strong><strong>Transmission Media</strong></h1>
        <p>In data communication terminology, a transmission medium is a physical path between the transmitter and the receiver i.e. it is the channel through which data is sent from one place to another. Transmission Media is broadly classified into the following types:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Guided Media:</strong>It is also referred to as Wired or Bounded transmission media. Signals being transmitted are directed and confined in a narrow pathway by using physical links.&nbsp;<br />Features:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>High Speed</li>
          <li>Secure</li>
          <li>Used for comparatively shorter distances</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are 3 major types of Guided Media:&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>i) Twisted Pair Cable &ndash;</strong><br />It consists of 2 separately insulated conductor wires wound about each other. Generally, several such pairs are bundled together in a protective sheath. They are the most widely used Transmission Media. Twisted Pair is of two types:&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):</strong><br />UTP consists of two insulated copper wires twisted around one another. This type of cable has the ability to block interference and does not depend on a physical shield for this purpose. It is used for telephonic applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Advantages:&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>⇢&nbsp;Least expensive</p>
        <p>⇢&nbsp;Easy to install</p>
        <p>⇢&nbsp;High-speed capacity</p>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
        <p>⇢&nbsp;Susceptible to external interference</p>
        <p>⇢&nbsp;Lower capacity and performance in comparison to STP</p>
        <p>⇢&nbsp;Short distance transmission due to attenuation</p>
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
        <p>Used in telephone connections and LAN networks</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shielded Twisted Pair (STP):</strong><br />This type of cable consists of a special jacket (a copper braid covering or a foil shield) to block external interference. It is used in fast-data-rate Ethernet and in voice and data channels of telephone lines.</li>
          <li>shield) to block external interference. It is used in fast-data-rate Ethernet and in voice and data channels of telephone lines.</li>

        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
        <p>⇢&nbsp;Comparatively difficult to install and manufacture</p>
        <p>⇢&nbsp;More expensive</p>
        <p>⇢&nbsp;Bulky</p>
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
        <p>The shielded twisted pair type of cable is most frequently used in extremely cold climates, where the additional layer of outer covering makes it perfect for withstanding such temperatures or for shielding the interior components.</p>
        <p><strong>(ii) Coaxial Cable &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It has an outer plastic covering containing an insulation layer made of PVC or Teflon and 2 parallel conductors each having a separate insulated protection cover. The coaxial cable transmits information in two modes: Baseband mode(dedicated cable bandwidth) and Broadband mode(cable bandwidth is split into separate ranges). Cable TVs and analog television networks widely use Coaxial cables.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>High Bandwidth</li>
          <li>Better noise Immunity</li>
          <li>Easy to install and expand</li>
          <li>Inexpensive</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Single cable failure can disrupt the entire network</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
        <p>Radio frequency signals are sent over coaxial wire. It can be used for cable television signal distribution, digital audio (S/PDIF), computer network connections (like Ethernet), and feedlines that connect radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas.</p>
        <p><strong>(iii) Optical Fiber Cable &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />It uses the concept of refraction of light through a core made up of glass or plastic. The core is surrounded by a less dense glass or plastic covering called the cladding. It is used for the transmission of large volumes of data.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The cable can be unidirectional or bidirectional. The WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexer) supports two modes, namely unidirectional and bidirectional mode.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased capacity and bandwidth</li>
          <li>Lightweight</li>
          <li>Less signal attenuation</li>
          <li>Immunity to electromagnetic interference</li>
          <li>Resistance to corrosive materials</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Difficult to install and maintain</li>
          <li>High cost</li>

          <li>Defence Purpose: Used in transmission of data in aerospace.</li>
          <li>For Communication: This is largely used in formation of internet cables.</li>
          <li>Industrial Purpose: Used for lighting purposes and safety measures in designing the interior and exterior of automobiles.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong> Unguided Media:</strong><br />It is also referred to as Wireless or Unbounded transmission media. No physical medium is required for the transmission of electromagnetic signals.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Features:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The signal is broadcasted through air</li>
          <li>Less Secure</li>
          <li>Used for larger distances</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are 3 types of Signals transmitted through unguided media:&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(i) Radio waves &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />These are easy to generate and can penetrate through buildings. The sending and receiving antennas need not be aligned. Frequency Range:3KHz &ndash; 1GHz. AM and FM radios and cordless phones use Radio waves for transmission.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Further Categorized as (i) Terrestrial and (ii) Satellite.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(ii) Microwaves &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />It is a line of sight transmission i.e. the sending and receiving antennas need to be properly aligned with each other. The distance covered by the signal is directly proportional to the height of the antenna. Frequency Range:1GHz &ndash; 300GHz. These are majorly used for mobile phone communication and television distribution.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Microwave Transmission</em></p>
        <p><strong>(iii) Infrared &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<br />Infrared waves are used for very short distance communication. They cannot penetrate through obstacles. This prevents interference between systems. Frequency Range:300GHz &ndash; 400THz. It is used in TV remotes, wireless mouse, keyboard, printer, etc.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1><strong>Transmission Impairment in Data Communication</strong></h1>
        <p>In communication system, analog signals travel through transmission media, which tends to deteriorate the quality of analog signal, which means that the signal at the beginning of the medium is not the same as the signal &nbsp;at the end of the medium. The imperfection causes signal impairment. Below are the causes of the impairment.</p>
        <p><strong>Causes of impairment &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><br /></strong><strong>Attenuation &ndash;</strong>It means loss of energy. The strength of signal decreases with increasing distance which causes loss of energy in overcoming resistance of medium. This is also known as attenuated signal. Amplifiers are used to amplify the attenuated signal which gives the original signal back and compensate for this loss.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Image Source &ndash;&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Attenuation is measured in&nbsp;<strong>decibels(dB)</strong>. It measures the relative strengths of two signals or one signal at two different point.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><em>Attenuation(dB) = 10log10(P2/P1)</em></strong></p>
        <p>P1 is the power at sending end and P2 is the power at receiving &nbsp;end.</p>
        <p>Some where the decibel is also define in terms of voltage instead of power.In this case because power is proportional to the square of the voltage the formula is &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><em>Attenuation(dB) = 20log10(V2/V1)</em></strong></p>
        <p>V1 is the voltage at sending end and V2 is the voltage at receiving end.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Distortion &ndash;</strong>It means changes in the form or shape of the signal. This is generally seen in composite signals made up with different frequencies. Each frequency component has its own propagation speed travelling through a medium. And thats why it delay in arriving at the final destination Every component arrive at different time which leads to distortion. Therefore, they have different phases at receiver end from what they had at senders end.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Noise &ndash;</strong>The random or unwanted signal that mixes up with the original signal is called noise. There are several types of noise such as induced noise, crosstalk noise, thermal noise and impulse noise which may corrupt the signal.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Induced</strong>&nbsp;noise comes from sources such as motors and appliances. These devices act as sending antenna and transmission medium act as receiving antenna.&nbsp;<strong>Thermal</strong>&nbsp;noise is movement of electrons in wire which creates an extra signal.&nbsp;<strong>Crosstalk</strong>&nbsp;noise is when one wire affects the other wire.&nbsp;<strong>Impulse</strong>&nbsp;noise is a signal with high energy that comes from lightning or power lines&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To find the theoretical bit rate limit, we need to know the ration .The signal-to-noise ratio is defined as</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1><strong>Performance</strong></h1>
        <p>The performance of a network pertains to the measure of service quality of a network as perceived by the user. There are different ways to measure the performance of a network, depending upon the nature and design of the network. Finding the performance of a network depends on both quality of the network and the quantity of the network.</p>
        <h2><strong>Parameters for Measuring Network Performance</strong></h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-bandwidth/">Bandwidth</a></li>
          <li>Latency (Delay)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delays-in-computer-network/">Bandwidth &ndash; Delay Product</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-bandwidth-and-throughput/">Throughput</a></li>
          <li>Jitter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>BANDWIDTH</strong></h3>
        <p>One of the most essential conditions of a website&rsquo;s performance is the amount of bandwidth allocated to the network. Bandwidth determines how rapidly the webserver is able to upload the requested information. While there are different factors to consider with respect to a site&rsquo;s performance, bandwidth is every now and again the restricting element.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bandwidth in Hertz:</strong>It is the range of frequencies contained in a composite signal or the range of frequencies a channel can pass. For example, let us consider the bandwidth of a subscriber telephone line as 4 kHz.</li>
          <li><strong>Bandwidth in Bits per Seconds:</strong>It refers to the number of bits per second that a channel, a link, or rather a network can transmit. For example, we can say the bandwidth of a Fast Ethernet network is a maximum of 100 Mbps, which means that the network can send 100 Mbps of data.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>LATENCY&nbsp;</strong></h3>
        <p>In a network, during the process of data communication, latency(also known as delay) is defined as the total time taken for a complete message to arrive at the destination, starting with the time when the first bit of the message is sent out from the source and ending with the time when the last bit of the message is delivered at the destination. The network connections where small delays occur are called &ldquo;Low-Latency-Networks&rdquo; and the network connections which suffer from long delays are known as &ldquo;High-Latency-Networks&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In simpler terms latency may be defined as the time required to successfully send a packet across a network.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>It is measured in many ways like a round trip, one-way, etc.</li>
          <li>It might be affected by any component in the chain utilized to vehiculate data, like workstations, WAN links, routers, LAN, and servers, and eventually may be limited for large networks, by the speed of light.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p><em>Latency = Propagation Time + Transmission Time + Queuing Time + Processing Delay</em></p>
        <p><strong>Propagation Time</strong></p>
        <p>It is the time required for a bit to travel from the source to the destination. Propagation time can be calculated as the ratio between the link length (distance) and the propagation speed over the communicating medium. For example, for an electric signal, propagation time is the time taken for the signal to travel through a wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Propagation time = Distance / Propagation speed</em></p>
        <p><strong>Transmission Time</strong></p>
        <p>Transmission Time is a time based on how long it takes to send the signal down the transmission line. It consists of time costs for an EM signal to propagate from one side to the other, or costs like the training signals that are usually put on the front of a packet by the sender, which helps the receiver synchronize clocks. The transmission time of a message relies upon the size of the message and the bandwidth of the channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Transmission time = Message size / Bandwidth</p>
        <p><strong>Queuing Time</strong></p>
        <p>Queuing time is a time based on how long the packet has to sit around in the router. Quite frequently the wire is busy, so we are not able to transmit a packet immediately.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Processing Delay</strong></p>
        <p>Processing delay is the delay based on how long it takes the router to figure out where to send the packet. As soon as the router finds it out, it will queue the packet for transmission. These costs are predominantly based on the complexity of the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>THROUGHPUT&nbsp;</strong></h3>
        <p>Throughput is the number of messages successfully transmitted per unit time. It is controlled by available bandwidth, the available signal-to-noise ratio, and hardware limitations. The maximum throughput of a network may be consequently higher than the actual throughput achieved in everyday consumption. The terms &lsquo;throughput&rsquo; and &lsquo;bandwidth&rsquo; are often thought of as the same, yet they are different. Bandwidth is the potential measurement of a link, whereas throughput is an actual measurement of how fast we can send data.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>JITTER&nbsp;</strong></h3>
        <p>Jitter is another performance issue related to the delay. In technical terms, jitter is a &ldquo;packet delay variance&rdquo;. It can simply mean that jitter is considered a problem when different packets of data face different delays in a network and the data at the receiver application is time-sensitive, i.e. audio or video data. Jitter is measured in milliseconds(ms). It is defined as an interference in the normal order of sending data packets. For example: if the delay for the first packet is 10 ms, for the second is 35 ms, and for the third is 50 ms, then the real-time destination application that uses the packets experiences jitter.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><br /></strong><strong>Wavelength</strong></p>
        <p>Wavelength is a measure of distance a signal can travel in a period. It is the distance between corresponding points. The units of wavelength are meter, centimeters, etc.</p>
        <p>The Wavelength depends on frequency and medium.</p>
        <p>Frequency and Wavelength are inversely related to each other.</p>
        <p>Wavelength =&nbsp;Propagation Speed/&nbsp;Frequency</p>
        <h2><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Shannon Capacity</strong></h2>
