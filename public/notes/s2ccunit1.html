        <p><strong>CLOUD COMPUTING</strong></p>
        <p><strong>UNIT-I</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first time you hear the term Cloud Computing, you probably have asked yourself these questions: &ldquo;<strong>What exactly is the Cloud in Cloud computing?</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>Why do so many companies use it?</strong>&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Basically,&nbsp;<strong>cloud computing</strong>&nbsp;is an on-demand computing service that you can avail over the Internet to host and run your applications. The &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; in cloud computing simply refers to the underlying network or servers that run your web applications, database, and many others. Of course, the term &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; does not allude to that white, puffy, and cotton-looking thing in the sky. The physical servers are not hovering above the troposphere either. These servers are actually hosted on data centers around the world and possibly could be situated in one of the buildings in the city that you live in.</p>
        <p>In the past, before you could launch a website or an enterprise application, you needed to procure and set up your own physical servers first to deploy your applications. You are also responsible for managing, patching, and troubleshooting your servers and network devices. The problem here is that it takes a lot of time, effort and money just to make your solutions available online.</p>
        <p>But with&nbsp;<strong>cloud computing</strong>, all you need to do is avail of the computing services over the Internet and the cloud service provider will be responsible for managing the underlying infrastructure that runs your websites. It&rsquo;s like you are &lsquo;renting&rsquo; a server and after you are done using it, you have the option to end your subscription to stop accumulating unnecessary costs. This empowers you, as well other businesses, to focus on building solutions rather than spending a lot of time setting up and managing servers.</p>
        <p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong>&nbsp;provides a plethora of helpful services that small and big companies can leverage on. Its services include domain registration, Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, machine learning, gaming, mobile development, Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS), quantum computing and many more. This is why there are so many companies and even startups leveraging its power to launch their products faster, save on operating costs, and scale globally with ease.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits of Cloud Computing</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Agility</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have the ability to quickly adapt and deploy services in the most costeffective way in response to changes in business requirements.</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong> Elasticity</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the case of varying workloads, it allows your resources to adjust quickly and to scale back and forth as the business capacity and needs change.</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><strong> Cost Savings</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Instead of building and managing your own data center and physical servers, you can trade your Capital Expenses for Operational Expenses and pay only the amount you consume.</p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li><strong> Deploy Globally in Minutes</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>With just a few clicks, you can quickly deploy your application to different locations and enhance the experience of your users with reduced latency.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Fundamental of Cloud Computing</strong></p>
        <p>Cloud services are usually classified by their general use cases that make up an IT infrastructure. You can think of them as lego blocks. One piece of a lego block looks dull and doesn&rsquo;t really mean much. But once you&rsquo;ve learned how to fit those blocks on top of each other in a creative fashion, you could build anything that you can think of! Interestingly , I&rsquo;ve seen someone build a Titanic replica out of lego pieces before. And just like those lego blocks, you can create&nbsp;enoughany Cloud architecture that you want in a short span of time by connecting the fundamental blocks together in congruence to your needs.</p>
        <p>Some of the fundamental blocks of Cloud Computing are&nbsp;<strong>Compute</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Storage</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Database</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Networking</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Security</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Compute</strong></p>
        <p>Instead of provisioning your server in a local data center, you can outsource the computing power needed by your server from a cluster of virtual machines in the Cloud. Compute is the processing power required by applications and systems to process data and carry out computational tasks.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The compute capacity of a virtual machine solely depends on the hardware resources attributed to its host computer. The compute resources refer to the CPU, Storage, Memory, and the Network Bandwidth available to the machine where your VM is running. Today, most cloud service providers have done a pretty good job designing a wide selection of pre-configured machines that can accommodate a variety of workloads.</p>
        <p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
        <p>The main benefit of storing data in the cloud is the convenience of increasing your storage capacity without maintaining and buying more local hard drives. You cannot prevent data corruption from happening in the event of a hard disk failure. In the cloud, your data is stored persistently across logical pools in physical storage hosted by your cloud service provider. You can store different types of data such as objects, files, and backups.</p>
        <p><strong>Database</strong></p>
        <p>The database is a system that stores and manages structured and unstructured information. Databases in the cloud are typically managed and offered as a service by a cloud service provider. This means that maintaining and updating the underlying components of your database instance, such as OS updates and software patches, are no longer your responsibility. Databases in the cloud are also scalable and highly available in nature.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Networking</strong></p>
        <p>The cloud is a large ecosystem of computers that communicate and integrate with each other to deliver a specific service to customers. Cloud service providers make sure that they always maintain a high-speed network connection within their infrastructures to support the needs of their end-users. You can use the cloud to provide a global link to distribute your application all over the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>In the cloud, data is stored in secured remote data center facilities. This means that threats like theft and data breach are unlikely going to happen. As a cloud user, your responsibility is more on data management. The cloud has sets of tools to help you enforce high levels of security. For example, you have control on the encryption and decryption of your data. You can also choose to authenticate and authorize selected users and services to access your applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Computing Paradigms</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;In fact different computing paradigms have existed before the cloud computing paradigm. Let us take a look at all the computing paradigms below.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Distributed Computing: </strong><br />Distributed computing is defined as a type of computing where multiple computer systems work on a single problem. Here all the computer systems are linked together and the problem is divided into sub-problems where each part is solved by different computer systems.<br />The goal of distributed computing is to increase the performance and efficiency of the system and ensure fault tolerance.<br />In the below diagram, each processor has its own local memory and all the processors communicate with each other over a network.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong> Parallel Computing :</strong><br />Parallel computing is defined as a type of computing where multiple computer systems are used simultaneously. Here a problem is broken into sub-problems and then further broken down into instructions. These instructions from each sub-problem are executed concurrently on different processors.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here in the below diagram you can see how the parallel computing system consists of multiple processors that communicate with each other and perform multiple tasks over a shared memory simultaneously.</p>
        <p>The goal of parallel computing is to save time and provide concurrency.<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><strong> Cluster Computing :</strong><br />A cluster is a group of independent computers that work together to perform the tasks given.<br />Cluster computing is defined as a type of computing that consists of two or more independent computers, referred to as nodes, that work together to execute tasks as a single machine.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The goal of cluster computing is to increase the performance, scalability and simplicity of the system.</p>
        <p>As you can see in the below diagram, all the nodes, (irrespective of whether they are a parent node or child node), act as a single entity to perform the tasks.<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li><strong> Grid Computing :</strong><br />Grid computing is defined as a type of computing where it is constitutes a network of computers that work together to perform tasks that may be difficult for a single machine to handle. All the computers on that network work under the same umbrella and are termed as a virtual super computer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The tasks they work on is of either high computing power and consist of large data sets.<br />All communication between the computer systems in grid computing is done on the &ldquo;data grid&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>The goal of grid computing is to solve more high computational problems in less time and improve productivity.<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="5">
          <li><strong> Utility Computing :</strong><br />Utility computing is defined as the type of computing where the service provider provides the needed resources and services to the customer and charges them depending on the usage of these resources as per requirement and demand, but not of a fixed rate.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Utility computing involves the renting of resources such as hardware, software, etc. depending on the demand and the requirement.</p>
        <p>The goal of utility computing is to increase the usage of resources and be more cost-efficient.<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="6">
          <li><strong> Edge Computing :</strong><br />Edge computing is defined as the type of computing that is focused on decreasing the long distance communication between the client and the server. This is done by running fewer processes in the cloud and moving these processes onto a user&rsquo;s computer, IoT device or edge device/server.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The goal of edge computing is to bring computation to the network&rsquo;s edge which in turn builds less gap and results in better and closer interaction.<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="7">
          <li><strong> Fog Computing :</strong><br />Fog computing is defined as the type of computing that acts a computational structure between the cloud and the data producing devices. It is also called as &ldquo;fogging&rdquo;.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This structure enables users to allocate resources, data, applications in locations at a closer range within each other.</p>
        <p>The goal of fog computing is to improve the overall network efficiency and performance.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="8">
          <li><strong> Cloud Computing: </strong><br />Cloud is defined as the usage of someone else&rsquo;s server to host, process or store data.<br />Cloud computing is defined as the type of computing where it is the delivery of on-demand computing services over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. It is widely distributed, network-based and used for storage.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There type of cloud are public, private, hybrid and community and some cloud providers are Google cloud, AWS, Microsoft Azure and IBM cloud.<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Evolution of Cloud Computing<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/evolution-of-cloud-computing/"><br /></a></p>
        <p>Cloud computing is all about renting computing services. This idea first came in the 1950s. In making cloud computing what it is today, five technologies played a vital role. These are distributed systems and its peripherals, virtualization, web 2.0, service orientation, and utility computing.</p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /></strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Distributed Systems:<br />It is a composition of multiple independent systems but all of them are depicted as a single entity to the users. The purpose of distributed systems is to share resources and also use them effectively and efficiently. Distributed systems possess characteristics such as scalability, concurrency, continuous availability, heterogeneity, and independence in failures. But the main problem with this system was that all the systems were required to be present at the same geographical location. Thus to solve this problem, distributed computing led to three more types of computing and they were-Mainframe computing, cluster computing, and grid computing.<br />&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Mainframe computing:<br />Mainframes which first came into existence in 1951 are highly powerful and reliable computing machines. These are responsible for handling large data such as massive input-output operations. Even today these are used for bulk processing tasks such as online transactions etc. These systems have almost no downtime with high fault tolerance. After distributed computing, these increased the processing capabilities of the system. But these were very expensive. To reduce this cost, cluster computing came as an alternative to mainframe technology.<br />&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Cluster computing:<br />In 1980s, cluster computing came as an alternative to mainframe computing. Each machine in the cluster was connected to each other by a network with high bandwidth. These were way cheaper than those mainframe systems. These were equally capable of high computations. Also, new nodes could easily be added to the cluster if it was required. Thus, the problem of the cost was solved to some extent but the problem related to geographical restrictions still pertained. To solve this, the concept of grid computing was introduced.<br />&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Grid computing:<br />In 1990s, the concept of grid computing was introduced. It means that different systems were placed at entirely different geographical locations and these all were connected via the internet. These systems belonged to different organizations and thus the grid consisted of heterogeneous nodes. Although it solved some problems but new problems emerged as the distance between the nodes increased. The main problem which was encountered was the low availability of high bandwidth connectivity and with it other network associated issues. Thus. cloud computing is often referred to as &ldquo;Successor of grid computing&rdquo;.<br />&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Virtualization:&nbsp;<br />It was introduced nearly 40 years back. It refers to the process of creating a virtual layer over the hardware which allows the user to run multiple instances simultaneously on the hardware. It is a key technology used in cloud computing. It is the base on which major cloud computing services such as Amazon EC2, VMware vCloud, etc work on. Hardware virtualization is still one of the most common types of virtualization.</li>
          <li>Web 2.0:<br />It is the interface through which the cloud computing services interact with the clients. It is because of Web 2.0 that we have interactive and dynamic web pages. It also increases flexibility among web pages. Popular examples of web 2.0 include Google Maps, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Needless to say, social media is possible because of this technology only. It gained major popularity in 2004.<br />&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Service orientation:<br />It acts as a reference model for cloud computing. It supports low-cost, flexible, and evolvable applications. Two important concepts were introduced in this computing model. These were Quality of Service (QoS) which also includes the SLA (Service Level Agreement) and Software as a Service (SaaS).<br />&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Utility computing:<br />It is a computing model that defines service provisioning techniques for services such as compute services along with other major services such as storage, infrastructure, etc which are provisioned on a pay-per-use basis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Components of cloud computing</strong></p>
        <p>As we know, cloud computing technology is used by both small and large organizations to&nbsp;<strong>store the information</strong>&nbsp;in cloud and&nbsp;<strong>access</strong>&nbsp;it from anywhere at anytime using the internet connection.</p>
        <p>Cloud computing architecture is a combination of&nbsp;<strong>service-oriented architecture</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>event-driven architecture</strong>.</p>
        <p>Cloud computing architecture is divided into the following two parts -</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Front End</li>
          <li>Back End</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The below diagram shows the architecture of cloud computing -</p>
        <p>Front End</p>
        <p>The front end is used by the client. It contains client-side interfaces and applications that are required to access the cloud computing platforms. The front end includes web servers (including Chrome, Firefox, internet explorer, etc.), thin &amp; fat clients, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>
        <p>Back End</p>
        <p>The back end is used by the service provider. It manages all the resources that are required to provide cloud computing services. It includes a huge amount of data storage, security mechanism, virtual machines, deploying models, servers, traffic control mechanisms, etc.</p>
        <p>Components of Cloud Computing Architecture</p>
        <p>There are the following components of cloud computing architecture -</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Client Infrastructure</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Client Infrastructure is a Front end component. It provides GUI (Graphical User Interface)&nbsp; to interact with the cloud.</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li><strong> Application</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The application may be any software or platform that a client wants to access.</p>
        <ol start="3">
          <li><strong> Service</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>A Cloud Services manages that which type of service you access according to the client&rsquo;s requirement.</p>
        <p>Cloud computing offers the following three type of services:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Software as a Service (SaaS) &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>It is also known as&nbsp;<strong>cloud application services</strong>. Mostly, SaaS applications run directly through the web browser means we do not require to download and install these applications. Some important example of SaaS is given below &ndash;</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;Google Apps, Salesforce Dropbox, Slack, Hubspot, Cisco WebEx.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong> Platform as a Service (PaaS) &ndash;</strong>It is also known as&nbsp;<strong>cloud platform</strong><strong>services</strong>. It is quite similar to SaaS, but the difference is that PaaS provides a platform for software creation, but using SaaS, we can access software over the internet without the need of any platform.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;Windows Azure, Force.com, Magento Commerce Cloud, OpenShift.</p>
        <p><strong>iii. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>It is also known as&nbsp;<strong>cloud infrastructure services</strong>. It is responsible for managing applications data, middleware, and runtime environments.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Google Compute Engine (GCE), Cisco Metapod.</p>
        <ol start="4">
          <li><strong> Runtime Cloud</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Runtime Cloud provides the&nbsp;<strong>execution and runtime environment</strong>&nbsp;to the virtual machines.</p>
        <ol start="5">
          <li><strong> Storage</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Storage is one of the most important components of cloud computing. It provides a huge amount of storage capacity in the cloud to store and manage data.</p>
        <ol start="6">
          <li><strong> Infrastructure</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>It provides services on the&nbsp;<strong>host level</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>application level</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>network level</strong>. Cloud infrastructure includes hardware and software components such as servers, storage, network devices, virtualization software, and other storage resources that are needed to support the cloud computing model.</p>
        <ol start="7">
          <li><strong> Management</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Management is used to manage components such as application, service, runtime cloud, storage, infrastructure, and other security issues in the backend and establish coordination between them.</p>
        <ol start="8">
          <li><strong> Security</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Security is an in-built back end component of cloud computing. It implements a security mechanism in the back end.</p>
        <ol start="9">
          <li><strong> Internet</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Internet is medium through which front end and back end can interact and communicate with each other.</p>
        <h1><strong>Characteristics of Cloud Computing</strong></h1>
        <h1><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1>
        <p>There are many characteristics of&nbsp;Cloud computing&nbsp;here are few of them:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>On-demand self-services:</strong>The Cloud computing services does not require any human administrators, user they are able to provision, monitor and manage computing resources as needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Broad network access:</strong>The Computing services are generally provided over standard networks and heterogeneous devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Rapid elasticity:</strong>The Computing services should have IT resources that are able to scale out and in quickly and on as needed basis. Whenever the user require services it is provided to him and it is scale out as soon as its requirement gets over.</li>
          <li><strong>Resource pooling:</strong>The IT resource (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) present are shared across multiple applications and occupant in an uncommitted manner. Multiple clients are provided service from a same physical resource.</li>
          <li><strong>Measured service:</strong>The resource utilization is tracked for each application and occupant, it will provide both the user and the resource provider with an account of what has been used. This is done for various reasons like monitoring billing and effective use of resource.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-tenancy:</strong>Cloud computing providers can support multiple tenants (users or organizations) on a single set of shared resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Virtualization:</strong>Cloud computing providers use virtualization technology to abstract underlying hardware resources and present them as logical resources to users.</li>
          <li><strong>Resilient computing:&nbsp;</strong>Cloud computing services are typically designed with redundancy and fault tolerance in mind, which ensures high availability and reliability.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible pricing models:&nbsp;</strong>Cloud providers offer a variety of pricing models, including pay-per-use, subscription-based, and spot pricing, allowing users to choose the option that best suits their needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Security:</strong>Cloud providers invest heavily in security measures to protect their users&rsquo; data and ensure the privacy of sensitive information.</li>
          <li><strong>Automation:</strong>Cloud computing services are often highly automated, allowing users to deploy and manage resources with minimal manual intervention.</li>
          <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong>Cloud providers are increasingly focused on sustainable practices, such as energy-efficient data centers and the use of renewable energy sources, to reduce their environmental impact.</li>
