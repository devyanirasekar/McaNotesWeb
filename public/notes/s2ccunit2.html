        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Cloud Computing can be defined as the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. Companies offering such kinds of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/architecture-of-cloud-computing/"><u>cloud computing</u></a>&nbsp;services are called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-5-cloud-platform-service-providers-in-2020/"><em><u>cloud providers</u></em></a>&nbsp;and typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage. Grids and clusters are the foundations for cloud computing.</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Cloud Computing</strong></p>
        <p>Most cloud computing services fall into three broad categories:&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Software as a service (SaaS)</li>
          <li>Platform as a service (PaaS)</li>
          <li>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are sometimes called the&nbsp;<strong>cloud computing stack</strong>&nbsp;because they are built on top of one another. Knowing what they are and how they are different, makes it easier to accomplish your goals. These abstraction layers can also be viewed as a&nbsp;<strong>layered architecture</strong>&nbsp;where services of a higher layer can be composed of services of the underlying layer i.e, SaaS can provide Infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><strong>Software as a Service(SaaS)</strong></h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-as-a-service-saas/"><u>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</u></a>&nbsp;is a way of delivering services and applications over the Internet. Instead of installing and maintaining software, we simply access it via the Internet, freeing ourselves from the complex software and hardware management. It removes the need to install and run applications on our own computers or in the data centers eliminating the expenses of hardware as well as software maintenance.&nbsp;<br />SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a&nbsp;<strong>pay-as-you-go</strong>&nbsp;basis from a cloud service provider. Most SaaS applications can be run directly from a web browser without any downloads or installations required. The SaaS applications are sometimes called&nbsp;<strong>Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Advantages of SaaS&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong>Pay only for what you use.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced time:</strong>Users can run most SaaS apps directly from their web browser without needing to download and install any software. This reduces the time spent in installation and configuration and can reduce the issues that can get in the way of the software deployment.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong>We can Access app data from anywhere.</li>
          <li><strong>Automatic updates:</strong>Rather than purchasing new software, customers rely on a SaaS provider to automatically perform the updates.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability:&nbsp;</strong>It allows the users to access the services and features on-demand.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The various companies providing&nbsp;<em>Software as a service</em>&nbsp;are Cloud9 Analytics, Salesforce.com, Cloud Switch, Microsoft Office 365, Big Commerce, Eloqua, dropBox, and Cloud Tran.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of Saas :</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Limited customization</strong>: SaaS solutions are typically not as customizable as on-premises software, meaning that users may have to work within the constraints of the SaaS provider&rsquo;s platform and may not be able to tailor the software to their specific needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Dependence on internet connectivity</strong>: SaaS solutions are typically cloud-based, which means that they require a stable internet connection to function properly. This can be problematic for users in areas with poor connectivity or for those who need to access the software in offline environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Security concerns:</strong>SaaS providers are responsible for maintaining the security of the data stored on their servers, but there is still a risk of data breaches or other security incidents.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited control over data:</strong>SaaS providers may have access to a user&rsquo;s data, which can be a concern for organizations that need to maintain strict control over their data for regulatory or other reasons.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Platform as a Service</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/platform-as-a-service-paas-and-its-types/"><u>PaaS</u></a>&nbsp;is a category of cloud computing that provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services over the internet. PaaS services are hosted in the cloud and accessed by users simply via their web browser.&nbsp;<br />A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. Thus, the development and deployment of the application take place&nbsp;<strong>independent of the hardware</strong>.&nbsp;<br />The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment. To make it simple, take the example of an annual day function, you will have two options either to create a venue or to rent a venue but the function is the same.</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages of PaaS:&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Simple and convenient for users:&nbsp;</strong>It provides much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which users can access anywhere via a web browser.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost-Effective:&nbsp;</strong>It charges for the services provided on a per-use basis thus eliminating the expenses one may have for on-premises hardware and software.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiently managing the lifecycle:</strong>It is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong>It allows for higher-level programming with reduced complexity thus, the overall development of the application can be more effective.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The various companies providing&nbsp;<em>Platform as a service</em>&nbsp;are Amazon Web services Elastic Beanstalk, Salesforce, Windows Azure, Google App Engine, cloud Bees and IBM smart cloud.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of Paas:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Limited control over infrastructure:</strong>PaaS providers typically manage the underlying infrastructure and take care of maintenance and updates, but this can also mean that users have less control over the environment and may not be able to make certain customizations.</li>
          <li><strong>Dependence on the provider</strong>: Users are dependent on the PaaS provider for the availability, scalability, and reliability of the platform, which can be a risk if the provider experiences outages or other issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited flexibility:</strong>PaaS solutions may not be able to accommodate certain types of workloads or applications, which can limit the value of the solution for certain organizations.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong></p>
        <p>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a service model that delivers computer infrastructure on an outsourced basis to support various operations. Typically IaaS is a service where infrastructure is provided as outsourcing to enterprises such as networking equipment, devices, database, and web servers.&nbsp;<br />It is also known as&nbsp;<strong>Hardware as a Service (HaaS).</strong>&nbsp;IaaS customers pay on a per-user basis, typically by the hour, week, or month. Some providers also charge customers based on the amount of virtual machine space they use.&nbsp;<br />It simply provides the underlying operating systems, security, networking, and servers for developing such applications, and services, and deploying development tools, databases, etc.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages of IaaS:&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong>Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost and IaaS customers pay on a per-user basis, typically by the hour, week, or month.</li>
          <li><strong>Website hosting:</strong>Running websites using IaaS can be less expensive than traditional web hosting.</li>
          <li><strong>Security:&nbsp;</strong>The IaaS Cloud Provider may provide better security than your existing software.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong>There is no need to manage the underlying data center or the introduction of new releases of the development or underlying software. This is all handled by the IaaS Cloud Provider.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The various companies providing&nbsp;<em>Infrastructure as a service</em>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/amazon-web-services-setting-up-an-aws-account/"><u>Amazon web services</u></a>, Bluestack, IBM, Openstack, Rackspace, and Vmware.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of laaS :</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Limited control over infrastructure:&nbsp;</strong>IaaS providers typically manage the underlying infrastructure and take care of maintenance and updates, but this can also mean that users have less control over the environment and may not be able to make certain customizations.</li>
          <li><strong>Security concerns</strong>: Users are responsible for securing their own data and applications, which can be a significant undertaking.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited access:&nbsp;</strong>Cloud computing may not be accessible in certain regions and countries due to legal policies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Anything as a Service</strong></p>
        <p>It is also known as Everything as a Service. Most of the cloud service providers nowadays offer anything as a service that is a compilation of all of the above services including some additional services.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages of XaaS: &nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Scalability:</strong>XaaS solutions can be easily scaled up or down to meet the changing needs of an organization.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>XaaS solutions can be used to provide a wide range of services, such as storage, databases, networking, and software, which can be customized to meet the specific needs of an organization.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong>: XaaS solutions can be more cost-effective than traditional on-premises solutions, as organizations only pay for the services.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of XaaS:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Dependence on the provider:&nbsp;</strong>Users are dependent on the XaaS provider for the availability, scalability, and reliability of the service, which can be a risk if the provider experiences outages or other issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited flexibility</strong>: XaaS solutions may not be able to accommodate certain types of workloads or applications, which can limit the value of the solution for certain organizations.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited integration:</strong>XaaS solutions may not be able to integrate with existing systems and data sources, which can limit the value of the solution for certain organizations.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Service-Oriented Architecture</strong></p>
        <p>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a stage in the evolution of application development and/or integration. It defines a way to make software components reusable using the interfaces.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Formally, SOA is an architectural approach in which applications make use of services available in the network. In this architecture, services are provided to form applications, through a network call over the internet.&nbsp;It uses common communication standards to speed up and streamline the service integrations in applications. Each service in SOA is a complete business function in itself. The services are published in such a way that it makes it easy for the developers to assemble their apps using those services. Note that SOA is different from microservice architecture.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>SOA allows users to combine a large number of facilities from existing services to form applications.</li>
          <li>SOA encompasses a set of design principles that structure system development and provide means for integrating components into a coherent and decentralized system.</li>
          <li>SOA-based computing packages functionalities into a set of interoperable services, which can be integrated into different software systems belonging to separate business domains.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The different characteristics of SOA are as follows :&nbsp;</strong><br />o Provides interoperability between the services.&nbsp;<br />o Provides methods for service encapsulation, service discovery, service composition,&nbsp;<br />service reusability and service integration.&nbsp;<br />o Facilitates QoS (Quality of Services) through service contract based on Service Level&nbsp;<br />Agreement (SLA).&nbsp;<br />o Provides loosely couples services.&nbsp;<br />o Provides location transparency with better scalability and availability.&nbsp;<br />o Ease of maintenance with reduced cost of application development and&nbsp;<br />deployment.<br />There are two major roles within Service-oriented Architecture:&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Service provider:</strong>The service provider is the maintainer of the service and the organization that makes available one or more services for others to use. To advertise services, the provider can publish them in a registry, together with a service contract that specifies the nature of the service, how to use it, the requirements for the service, and the fees charged.</li>
          <li><strong>Service consumer:</strong>The service consumer can locate the service metadata in the registry and develop the required client components to bind and use the service.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Services might aggregate information and data retrieved from other services or create workflows of services to satisfy the request of a given service consumer. This practice is known as service orchestration Another important interaction pattern is service choreography, which is the coordinated interaction of services without a single point of control.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Components of SOA:</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Guiding Principles of SOA:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Standardized service contract:&nbsp;</strong>Specified through one or more service description documents.</li>
          <li><strong>Loose coupling:</strong>Services are designed as self-contained components, maintain relationships that minimize dependencies on other services.</li>
          <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong>A service is completely defined by service contracts and description documents. They hide their logic, which is encapsulated within their implementation.</li>
          <li><strong>Reusability:</strong>Designed as components, services can be reused more effectively, thus reducing development time and the associated costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong>Services have control over the logic they encapsulate and, from a service consumer point of view, there is no need to know about their implementation.</li>
          <li><strong>Discoverability:</strong>Services are defined by description documents that constitute supplemental metadata through which they can be effectively discovered. Service discovery provides an effective means for utilizing third-party resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Composability:</strong>Using services as building blocks, sophisticated and complex operations can be implemented. Service orchestration and choreography provide a solid support for composing services and achieving business goals.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Advantages of SOA:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service reusability:</strong>In SOA, applications are made from existing services. Thus, services can be reused to make many applications.</li>
          <li><strong>Easy maintenance:</strong>As services are independent of each other they can be updated and modified easily without affecting other services.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform independent:</strong>SOA allows making a complex application by combining services picked from different sources, independent of the platform.</li>
          <li><strong>Availability:</strong>SOA facilities are easily available to anyone on request.</li>
          <li><strong>Reliability:</strong>SOA applications are more reliable because it is easy to debug small services rather than huge codes</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability:&nbsp;</strong>Services can run on different servers within an environment, this increases scalability</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of SOA:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High overhead:</strong>A validation of input parameters of services is done whenever services interact this decreases performance as it increases load and response time.</li>
          <li><strong>High investment:</strong>A huge initial investment is required for SOA.</li>
          <li><strong>Complex service management:</strong>When services interact they exchange messages to tasks. the number of messages may go in millions. It becomes a cumbersome task to handle a large number of messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Practical applications of SOA:</strong>&nbsp;SOA is used in many ways around us whether it is mentioned or not.&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>SOA infrastructure is used by many armies and air forces to deploy situational awareness systems.</li>
          <li>SOA is used to improve healthcare delivery.</li>
          <li>Nowadays many apps are games and they use inbuilt functions to run. For example, an app might need GPS so it uses the inbuilt GPS functions of the device. This is SOA in mobile solutions.</li>
          <li>SOA helps maintain museums a virtualized storage pool for their information and content.</li>
        </ol>
