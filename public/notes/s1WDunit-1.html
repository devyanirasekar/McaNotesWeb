        <h1 class="sc-167aua0-1 sc-jr97bh-3 cltmLY gnfqah">Web Design Principles:</h1>
      </div>
      <div style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>1. &nbsp;A good website should be easy to navigate.</strong><br />A website that is easy to use is crucial because if the visitor finds it difficult to navigate from one page to another, he or she will get frustrated and leave the website. Attracting frustrated visitors to come back to visit the site is extremely difficult.<br />&nbsp;<br />With Website Designer 2.0, you can create&nbsp;<strong>customizable</strong>&nbsp;drop down menus, so that the visitor can easily find what they are looking for with a few clicks of the mouse. Most importantly, these menu items are available from any page on the site, so in a couple of clicks, visitors are able to jump to other areas of interest with little effort on their part.</div>
      <div style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>2. &nbsp;Have a clear indication of where the user is.</strong><br />The website&rsquo;s visitor should always have a clear indication of which site page they are on and how they got there, thus making navigation easier.<br />&nbsp;<br />Website Designer 2.0 automatically creates a bread crumb trail so that your visitors can keep track of where they are on your site, and allows them to click on any of the items to go back to that level. Examples include the events calendar, stories and news pages.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>3. &nbsp;URL should be easy to remember</strong><br />One of the most common mistakes in website design is choosing a proper domain name. Your domain name should be easy to remember and easy to spell.<br />&nbsp;<br />With ClubRunner, you have the choice of picking your very own domain name, including .org, .com, or any of the available global extensions. Most non-profit service clubs opt for the .org extension as that is the one reserved for organizations. The most commonly used format is www.[town][organization name].org, for example, www.sunnyvillerotary.org.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>4. &nbsp;Website should be easy to find/look up/search for</strong><br />Although, once upon a time, the &lsquo;if you build it, they will come&rsquo; mantra worked for websites &ndash; it no longer does. Due to the fact that there are millions of websites on the Internet, it becomes important for you to ensure that your website ranks high in search engine results and is easy to find.</div>
      <div style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>5. &nbsp;Website should work on multiple browsers</strong><br />Gone are the days where the only Internet browser that everybody used was Netscape. Today, there are various Internet browsers that people prefer to use. Thus, it becomes imperative that your website be able to load on any browser &ndash; whether that be Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari or Google Chrome.<br />&nbsp;<br />ClubRunner websites are thoroughly tested to work not only on every browser out there, but because we support unicode, you can post contents in any another language! Also, as part of Version 2.0, ClubRunner&rsquo;s interface supports multiple languages, so you can completely change the experience your visitors and members have to fit your preferred language.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>6. &nbsp;Content should be updated often</strong><br />The real factor that drives a website towards becoming successful is the content. If content is not updated often, visitors of the website have no reason to visit the site often. Updating content on a regular basis becomes difficult if one does not know HTML and has to rely on a webmaster, which may not always be available.<br />&nbsp;<br />With Website Designer 2.0, there is absolutely no need to know any programming language or have any prior web experience. Furthermore, you can eliminate the need for a webmaster thanks to ClubRunner&rsquo;s intuitive design interface. You even have the opportunity to invite other members of your club to update content on your site simply by granting them access rights. You can easily update your eBulletin on a daily basis and share any news or information on your homepage with a click of a mouse. The best part is that you can do all this at your own pace and at your own time, so you can make sure that your website is content-centric at all times.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>7. &nbsp;Layout consistency is key</strong><br />It is important for all your website pages to follow a certain layout in order to maintain a theme and uniformity. If the layout of your website pages are not consistent with one another, your website will look untidy and disorganized, thus not properly reflecting your club&rsquo;s image online.<br />&nbsp;<br />With Website Designer 2.0, you have the ability to choose from different layouts which will be applied to all your site pages. This will ensure the consistency that is required in any website design. Further, you are free to continue changing the look and feel without having to redo any content. This makes it easy to refresh the site with a mini-makeover within minutes!<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>8. &nbsp;Eliminate Clutter</strong><br />Another common mistake that many people make is placing as much content as they can, on one page. Often, many people place so much information together that the visitor has an information overload.</div>
      <div style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>9. &nbsp;Website should be quick to download</strong><br />In today&rsquo;s fast paced world, patience is slowly becoming a thing of the past. Website visitors want the website to load fast and want to be able to look at photos, articles, and watch videos immediately. When a website has too many large images within it, it will take longer to load. This leads to frustrated visitors who end up leaving your site.<br />&nbsp;<br />As ClubRunner as your website host, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about slow download times as our world class data network will ensure that your website download time is quick and optimized. All images that are uploaded through our Image Uploader are automatically compressed for fast download speeds. You can feel free to upload your pictures using our Photo Albums module, which also creates a neat slideshow view automatically.</div>
      <div style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>10. &nbsp;Have the SSL encrypted pages if dealing with monetary transactions</strong><br />In today&rsquo;s times, website visitors are naturally concerned with the security of websites. Here at ClubRunner, we ensure that any of our add-on modules that assist with credit card transactions and finances are developed to ensure the safety and security of those involved. Our servers encrypt all data so safety is never an issue. All monetary transactions are done through SSL encrypted pages that interface directly in real-time with our payment gateways, and we do not retain any personal or credit card information. Be assured that a transaction is encrypted by checking that the address bar on the website starts with &lsquo;https&rsquo;.<br />&nbsp;<br />
        <h1>Designing navigation bar:</h1>
        <div style="margin: 5px 0;">
          <p>Designing a website involves several key elements, including the navigation bar, page design, home page layout, and design concept. Here's an overview of each:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Navigation Bar:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>The navigation bar, or navbar, is a crucial component that helps users navigate through your website. It typically includes links to various pages or sections of the site.</li>
                <li>Design the navigation bar to be user-friendly, ensuring that it is easily accessible and provides clear and concise labels for each section.</li>
                <li>Consider using familiar navigation patterns, such as a horizontal menu at the top of the page or a side menu for mobile devices.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Page Design:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Page design involves structuring individual pages to enhance the user experience. This includes the arrangement of content, images, and other elements.</li>
                <li>Use a grid system to create a balanced layout, helping to organize content and maintain visual harmony.</li>
                <li>Ensure that there is sufficient white space to prevent the page from feeling cluttered, and make use of contrast to highlight important elements.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Home Page Layout:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>The home page is often the first impression users have of your website, so its design is crucial. Consider the following elements:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Hero Section: A visually striking area at the top of the page, often featuring a headline, subheadline, and a call-to-action (CTA) button.</li>
                    <li>Featured Content: Highlight key products, services, or information that you want users to notice immediately.</li>
                    <li>Clear Navigation: Ensure that the navigation bar is easily accessible, helping users explore the rest of the site.</li>
                    <li>Engaging Visuals: Use high-quality images, graphics, and possibly videos to capture attention and convey your brand's personality.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Design Concept:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>The design concept is the overarching idea that guides the visual and functional aspects of your website. It should align with your brand identity and the goals of your site.</li>
                <li>Choose a color scheme that reflects your brand and creates a cohesive look across the website.</li>
                <li>Typography: Select fonts that are easy to read and complement your brand image.</li>
                <li>Consistency: Maintain a consistent design throughout the site to create a unified and professional appearance.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
