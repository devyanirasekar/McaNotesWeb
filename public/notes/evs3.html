<p>31 AND <br/>ENVIRONMENT <br/></p>
<p>31.1 POPULATION GROWTH <br/>Population is a term referring to the total human inhabitants of a specified arca, such as a <br/>city, country, or continent, at a given time. Population study as a discipline is known as <br/>demography. It is concerned with the size, composition, and distribution of populations; <br/>their patterns of change over time through births, deaths, and migration; and the determinants <br/>and consequences of such changes. Population studies yield knowledge important for planning, <br/>particularly by governments, in fields such as health, education, housing, social security, <br/>employment, and environmental preservation. Such studies also provide information needed <br/>to formulate government population policies, which seek to modify demographic trends in <br/>order to achieve economic and social objectives. <br/></p>
<p>Demography is an interdisciplinary field involving mathematics and statistics, biology, <br/>medicine, sociology, economics, history, geography, and anthropology. <br/></p>
<p>31.2 MEASURE OF PoPULATION <br/>The numbers of births, deaths, immigrants, and emigrants over a specified time interval <br/>determine the change in population size. For comparative purposes, these components of <br/>change are expressed as proportions of the total population, to yield the birth rate, death<br/>rate, migration rates, and the population growth rate. (Birth and death rates typically are <br/>stated as numbers per 1,000 population per year.) These rates are affected by the age- <br/>composition of the population; for example, a very healthy population, which, as a result, <br/>has a relatively large proportion of old people, might have a death rate similar to that of a <br/>poor population made up of predominantly younger members. Demographers, therefore, <br/>often use measures that are free of this age-distribution influence. Two such widely used <br/>measures are the total fertility rate (TFR) and the life expectancy at birth.<br/></p>
<p>The total fertility rate is the number of children a woman would have during her <br/>reproductive life if she experienced the prevailing rates of fertility at each age. High-fertility countries may have birth rates of 40 or even 50 per 1,000 population (per year); correspondinnglevels of the TFR would be 5 to 7 children per woman. Low-fertility countries have birth <br/>rates of 15 to 20 per 1,000 and TFRs of about 2. &quot;Replacement level&quot; fertility (the level at <br/>which each person on average has a single successor in the next generation) corresponds to <br/>a TFR of about 2.1 under low-mortality conditions. <br/></p>
<p>The life expectancy at birth is the average length of life that would be observed in a </p>

<p>and life expectancies about 70 years are common. ther important mortality measure is the infant mortality rate. This is the probability <br/>in the first year of life, usually stated as a number per 1,000 births. Many less <br/></p>

<p>leath <br/>of ned countries have intant mortality rates above 100 per 1,000-that is, more than<br/>percent of  <br/>perceinfant mortality rates are about 15 per 1,000, or even lower. <br/></p>
<p>than 10 systems, <br/></p>
<p>31.3 POPULATION DENSITY <br/>Populati <br/>frequently <br/></p>
<p>lation density carn be used as a measurement of any tangible item. However it is most <br/>applied to living organisms. Population density is usually expressed in terms or <br/></p>
<p>items or organisn per unit area. <br/></p>
<p>Note that population density, according to this definition, depends on the scale of the <br/>ling area used, and is hard to define as a real-valued continuous function over the area <br/></p>
<p>1estion. If the items concerned are modelled as discrete points, the population density <br/>will iump up and down as the edge of the sampling area passed over individuals. Modelling <br/>do individuals as spatially extended objects has other problems, as the scale of the sampling <br/>rea approaches the scale of an object (for example, a person's scale may be regarded as the <br/>eie of the grounds of their dwelling place : for some people, this will be a large area). To resolve some of these problems, population density may be regarded, like coastline distance, as a scale-dependent fractal quantity. <br/></p>
<p>31.4 BIOLOGICAL POPULATION DENSITIES Population density is a common biological measurement and is often used by conservationists as a more appropriate measure than absolute numbers. Low population densities may cause an extinction vortex, where low densities lead to further reduced fertility. This is referred to as the Allee effect named after W.C. Allee, who first identified it. Examples of this may <br/>include <br/></p>
<p>1. Increased problems with locating mates in areas of low density. 2. Increased inbreeding in areas of low population density. 3. Increased susceptibility to catastrophic events in low population densities. However it should be noted that different species will have different expected densities. For example r selected species commonly have high population densities, while k selected species may have lower population densities. Low population densities may be associated with specialised mate location adaptations such as specialised pollinators, as is found. in the orchid family, (the Orchidaceae.) <br/>31.5 HUMAN PPULATION DENSITY <br/></p>
<p>For human beings, population density is the number of persons per unit of area (which may nclude or exclude inland water), though it may also be expressed in relation to habitable, nhibited, productive (or potentially productive) or cultivated area. a <br/>t is frequently measured in persons per square mile or persons per square kilometre or </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>436 HUMAN <br/>PoPULATION <br/></p>
<p>AND <br/>ENVIRONMENT <br/></p>
<p>Lare, which can be obtained simply by dividing the number of persons by the lana area <br/></p>
<p>neasured in square miles or in square kilometers or hectares. <br/></p>
<p>lnonly this may be calcula ted for a county, city, country or the entire world. In the <br/></p>
<p>ounty articles the density is based on land area. However, the list of countries by population <br/></p>
<p>density is based on total area, including inland water. <br/></p>
<p>Countries or territories with the highest population <br/>densities are <br/></p>
<p>Macau <br/>Monaco <br/></p>
<p>Hong Kong <br/>Singapore <br/></p>
<p>Gibraltar <br/></p>
<p>These territories share a relatively small area and an exceptionally high urbanization <br/></p>
<p>level, with an economically specialized citypopulation drawing also on rural resources <br/>outside <br/></p>
<p>the area, illustrating the difference between high popula tion density and overpopulation. <br/></p>
<p>The most densely populated large state is Bangladesh <br/>where 134 million people live ina <br/></p>
<p>highly agricultural area around the lower Ganges river, with a national population density <br/></p>
<p>in excess of 900 persons per km2. World overall population density presently averages 42 <br/></p>
<p>persons per km2. <br/></p>
<p>Cities with exceptionally high population <br/>densities are often <br/></p>
<p>considered to be <br/></p>
<p>overpopulated, though the extent to which this is case depends on factors like quality of <br/></p>
<p>housing and infrastructure or access to resources. <br/>Most of the largest <br/></p>
<p>densely-populated <br/></p>
<p>cities are in southern and eastern Asia, though Cairo and Lagos in Africa also fall into the <br/></p>
<p>category. <br/>City population is however, heavily dependent on the definition used for the urban <br/></p>
<p>area <br/>densities will be far higher for the central municipality than when more recently- <br/></p>
<p>developed and as yet administratively <br/>unincorporated <br/></p>
<p>suburbs are included, as in the concepts <br/></p>
<p>of agglomeration or metropolitan area, the later including <br/>sometimes neighbouring cities. <br/></p>
<p>31.6 VARIATION OF POPULATION <br/>GROWTH AMONG NATIONS <br/></p>
<p>The United Nations (UN), an accepted authority on population levels and trends, estimates <br/></p>
<p>that the world population reached 6 billion in 1999, and is increasing annually by more than <br/></p>
<p>77 million persons. The rate of increase, 1.3 percent per year, has fallen below the peak rate <br/></p>
<p>of 2 percent per year <br/>attained by 1970. By the late 2040s, the UN estimates, the growth rate <br/></p>
<p>will have fallen to about 0.64 percent annually, at which time more than 50 countries will <br/></p>
<p>experience negative growth. <br/></p>
<p>A. Past and Present Growth <br/></p>
<p>Estimates of world population before 1900 are based on fragmentary data, but scholars <br/></p>
<p>agree that, for most of human existence, long-run average population growth approached <br/></p>
<p>approximately 0.002 percent per year, or 20 per million inhabitants. According to UNestimates, <br/></p>
<p>the population of the world was about 300 million in the year AD 1, and it took more than <br/></p>
<p>1.500 years to reach the 500 million mark. Growth was not steady but was marked by <br/></p>
<p>oscillations dictated by climate, food supply, disease, and war. <br/></p>
<p>Starting in the 17th century, great advances in scientific knowledge, agriculture, industry, </p>

<p>size in 23 years. <br/>B. Regional Distribution <br/>As of 2000, 1.2 billion people lived in the developed nations of the world, and 4.9 billion <br/></p>
<p>2 <br/></p>
<p>a <br/></p>
<p>2 neople lived in the less-developed countries. By region, over half the world's population <br/>was in East and south Asia; China, with 1.3 billion inhabitants, and India, with some 1 <br/>billion, were the dominant contributors. Europe and the countries of the former USSR <br/>contained 14 percent, North and South America made up 14 percent. Africa had 13 percent, <br/></p>
<p>f <br/>and the Pacific Islands had about 1 percent of world population. <br/></p>
<p>d <br/>Differences in regional growth rates are altering these percentages over time. Africa's <br/></p>
<p>share of the world population is expected to more than double by the year 2025. The population <br/>of South Asia and Latin America is expected to remain nearly constant; in other regions, including East Asia, the population is expected to decline appreciably. The share o present developed nations in world population-20 percent in 2000-is expected to fall to 15 percent by 2025. Nine out of every ten persons who are now being added to the world's population are living in the less-developed courntries. <br/></p>
<p>e <br/></p>
<p>r  f the S <br/></p>
<p>C. Urban Concentration <br/>S As a country develops from primarily an agricultural to an industrial economy, large-scale migration of rural residents to towns and cities takes place. During this process, the growth rate of urban areas is typically double the pace of overall population increase. Some 29 percent of the world population was living in urban areas in 1950; this figure was 43 percent in 1990, and is projected to rise to 50 percent by the year 2005. <br/></p>
<p>Urbanization eventually leads to a severe decline in the number of people living in the countryside, with negative population growth rates in rural areas. Rapid gTowth of overall population has deferred this event in most less-developed countries, but it is projected to <br/>occur in the early decades of the 21st century. <br/></p>
<p>2 <br/></p>
<p>S <br/></p>
<p>Most migrants to the cities can be assumed to have bettered themselves in comparison to <br/>their former standard of living, despite the serious problems of overcrowding, substandard <br/>housing, and inadequate municipal services that characterize life for many arrivals to urban <br/>centers. Dealing with these conditions, especially in very large cities, presents massive <br/>aitficulties for the governments of less-developed countries.</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>438 HUMAN POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT <br/></p>
<p>D. Population Projections <br/>Ost of the potential parents of the next two decades have already been born. Population <br/></p>
<p>projections over his interval can, therefore, be made with reasonable confidence, barring <br/>catastrophic changes. Beyond wo decades, however, uncertainties about demographic <br/></p>
<p>agnitudes and other characteristics of human societies build up rapidly, making any <br/>projections somewhat speculative. <br/></p>
<p>P'rojections issued in 2000 show the world population increasing from 6.1 billion in 2000 <br/>to 7.9 billion in 2025 and 9.3 billion in 2050. &quot;High&quot; and &quot;low&quot; projections for 2025 are 84 <br/>billion and 7.5 billion respectively. The average world birth rate is projected to decline from <br/>the 1990 level of 26 per 1,000 to 22 per 1,000 at the end of the century and to 17.6 per 1,000in <br/>2025 (corresponding to a fall in TFR from 3.3 in 1990 to 2.4 in 2025). Because of the expanding <br/></p>
<p>share of the population at high-mortality ages, the average world death rate is expected to <br/>decline only slightly; from 9 (per 1,000) in 1990 to 8.4 in 2025. Averabge world life expectancy <br/>however, is projected to rise from 65 years in 1990 to 71.3 years in 2025. <br/></p>
<p>Wide variations in population growth will undoubtedly persist. In the developed world, <br/></p>
<p>population growth will continue to be very low and in some nations will even decline. <br/></p>
<p>Western Europe as a whole is projected to have a declining population after 2000. U.S. Census <br/>Bureau projections, assuming middle fertility and mortality levels, show U.S. population <br/></p>
<p>increasing from 250 million in 1990 to 349 million in 2025 and 420 million in 2050. Thereafter, <br/></p>
<p>Srowth would be virtually zero. <br/></p>
<p>The UN expects the less-developed countries to have steadily falling rates of population <br/>growth. For the less-developed world as a whole, the 1990 growth rate of 2.0 percent per <br/></p>
<p>year is projected to be cut in half by 2025. Africa will remain the region with the highest <br/></p>
<p>growth rate. In 1990 this rate was 3.1 percent; in 2025 it is projected to be about 2.0 percent. <br/></p>
<p>Africa's population would almost triple, from 629 million in 1990 to 1.36 billion in 2025, and <br/></p>
<p>then continue growing a a rate that would almost double the population size in another 35 <br/></p>
<p>years <br/>31.7 POPULATION GROWTH IN INDIA <br/></p>
<p>India is the largest democracy in the world. It accounts for more than 16 per cent of the <br/></p>
<p>world's population around mid-1998. This 16 per cent of lives on less than 2.5 per cent of the <br/></p>
<p>total land area of the planet Earth. Between 1995 and 2000, the population of the world has <br/></p>
<p>been estimated to hav&#23; increased at the rate of 1.33 per cent per year, adding an average of <br/></p>
<p>78 million persons each year. More than one fifth of this increase has been estimated to be <br/>accounted by the increase in population in India and this contribution has been the largest, <br/></p>
<p>even larger than the contribution of China, the most populous county is the world (United <br/>Nations, 1999). Projections prepared by the United Nations suggest that by the year 2050, <br/></p>
<p>population of India will increase to 1529 million which will account for more than 17 per cent <br/></p>
<p>of the estimated world population of 8909 million. This means that of the projected 2854 <br/></p>
<p>million increase in world population in the 50 years between 2000 arnd 2050, 515 million or <br/></p>
<p>more than 18 per cent will be confined to India alone. These projections also indicate that by <br/>the year 2050. India will become the most populous country of the world, surpassing China.<br/></p>
<p>Since nearly one fifth of the population increase in the world during the next 50 years will <br/>take place in India, population stabilization in the world as a whole will depend on the pace <br/></p>
<p>of demographic transition in India. </p>

In common parlance, the term specifically refers to the relationship of human population to the planet Earth. <br/></p>
<p>Malthus's theory <br/>Early in the 19th century, Thomas Malthus argued in An Essay on the Principle of Population that, if left unrestricted, human populations would continue to grow until they would become too large to be supported by the available agricultural land. At that point, the population would be restrained through mass famine and starvation. Malthus argued for population control, through &quot;moral restraint&quot;, to avoid this happening. <br/></p>
<p>Over the two hundred years which followed, famine has overtaken numerous individual regions; proponents of this theory state that these famines were examples of Malthusian catastrophes. On a global scale, however, food production has grown faster than population. It has often been argued that future pressures on food production, combined with threats to other aspects of the earth's habitat such as global warming, make overpopulation a still more serious threat in the future. Perhaps the best-known example of such an argument is The Limits to Growth, a report produced for the Club of Rome in the early of 1970s. <br/>Optimist's viewpoint on population growth <br/>Other studies have countered with the claim that the current population level of over six billion may be supported by current resources, or that the global population may grow to ten billion and still be within the Earth's carrying capacity. Buckminster Fuller and Barry Commoner were both proponents of the idea that human technology could keep up with Population growth indefinitely. The assumptions that underlie these claims, however, have <br/></p>
<p>he been strongly criticised. <br/>ly. In any case, many proponents of population control have averred that famine is far from <br/>ce deing the only problem attendant to overpopulation. These critics point out ultimate shortages :he of energy sources and other natural resources, as well as the importance of seriou  <br/></p>
<p>the Communicable diseases in dense populations and war over scarce resources such as land t is area. </p>

<p>31.9 FAMILY WELFARE PROGRAMMME <br/></p>
<p>Introduction <br/></p>
<p>India launched the National Family Welfare Programme in 1951 with the objective of <br/></p>
<p>&quot;reducing the birth rate to the extent necessary to stabilise the population at a level consistent <br/></p>
<p>with the requirement of the National economy&quot;. <br/></p>
<p>The Family Welfare Programme in India is recognised as a priority area, and is being <br/></p>
<p>implemented as a 100% Centrally sponsored programme. As per Constitution of India, Famil <br/>Planning is in the Concurrent list. The approach under the programme during the First arid <br/>Second Five Year Plans was mainly &quot;Clinical&quot; under which facilities for provision of services <br/></p>
<p>were created. However, on the basis of data brought out by the 1961 census, clinical approach <br/></p>
<p>adopted in the first two plans was replaced by &quot;Extension and Education Approach&quot; which <br/></p>
<p>envisaged expansion of services facilities along with spread of message of small family norm. <br/></p>
<p>Main components of the programme <br/></p>
<p>The following are the main components of Family Welfare programme : <br/>1. Maternal Health <br/></p>
<p>2. Child Health <br/>3. Population control/Stabilisation <br/></p>
<p>1. Matermal Health: Family Welfare Department is taking up all possible care for the <br/></p>
<p>safety of mothers during pregnancy and childbirth. The objective is to reduce the prevailing <br/></p>
<p>Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) which is roughly one maternal death for every 5 minutes <br/>somewhere in the country (100,000 maternal deaths per year) due to causes related to <br/></p>
<p>pregnancy and child birth. <br/>Antenatal Care (ANC): ANC services are available in all the Primary Health Sub-centres, <br/></p>
<p>Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centers, Rural FW Centres, District Hospitals <br/>etc. To ensure good health and safety of mothers during pregnancy the under mentioned <br/></p>
<p>services are being provided and pregnant mothers must take full advantage of it <br/>Early registration-before 12 weeks of pregnancy <br/></p>

<p>Introduction <br/>PC <br/></p>
<p>R <br/>By healthy, it means disease free body. The state of human health not only depends on the <br/>number of doctors and hospitals but also on clean environment. A polluted environment is a <br/></p>

<p>la <br/></p>
<p>unsustainable development. <br/>r <br/></p>
<p>Traditional hazards related to poverty and &quot;insuficient&quot; development are wide-ranging <br/>and include: lack of access to safe drinking-water; inadequate basic sanitation in the household <br/>and the community; indoor air polution from cooking and heating using coal or biomass <br/>fuel and inadequate solid waste disposal <br/></p>
<p>Modern hazards are related to development that lacks health-and-environment <br/>safeguards, and to unsustainable consumption of natural resources. They include : water <br/>pollution from popula ted areas, industry and intensive agriculture; urban air pollution from <br/>motor cars, coal power stations and industry; climate change; stratospheric ozorne depletion <br/>and transboundary pollution. <br/></p>
<p>The changing pattern of environmental health hazards and associated health risks- <br/>moving from &quot;traditional&quot; to &quot;modern&quot; with time and economic development-is known as <br/>the &quot;risk transition&quot;. <br/>A health-and-environment cause-effect framework <br/>But although we can identify and describe individual environmental health hazards, the <br/>relationship between hunman health and the environment is highly complex. For instance <br/>each of the traditional and moderm hazards is associated with a variety of aspects of economic <br/>and social development, which complicates analysis of their incidence of impact. <br/></p>
<p>Thus it is useful to adopt a framework within which the different interactions operating </p>

<p>Representation of women is particularly important in improving health status, since women <br/>have key roles in all societies with respect to basic living conditions. Yet women remain <br/>largely underrepresented at most levels of government, especially in ministerial and other <br/>executive bodies. More women in politics and decision-making positions would help to <br/>redefine political priorities, place new items on the political agenda, and provide new <br/>perspectives on mainstream political issues. <br/>Intersectoral actions for a healthy environment <br/>Along the same lines, an intersectoral approach is the most effective means of formulating <br/>environmental health policy, since it can help to ensure that priorities are coherent and do <br/>not conflict with those of individual sectors. Ministries of health and environment have key <br/>roles to play in such activity. Joint programmes involving these and other ministries would <br/>enable much more to be achieved in environment and health. Intermational agencies can also <br/>contribute much to environmental health policy development: through collaborative <br/>assessments, for example. <br/>Health for all the way ahead <br/>Action must follow policy. The WHO Health-for-All Policy has provided a framework for <br/>translating the preventive health message of Agenda 21 (major document to emerge from <br/>the Barth `ummit) into practical action to be undertaken by the institutions and professionals <br/>of the health and other sectors. It is currently being updated and renewed so that it meets <br/>the challenges of the 21st Century effectively, and is able to light &quot;the way ahead&quot; for health-<br/>and-environment actions towards sustainable development. <br/></p>

<p>for Primary and Secondary Education (1988), the crisis of values our society is passing through <br/>demands more explicit and deliberate educational efforts towards value development&quot;. <br/></p>

The <br/>Conference of Vice-Chancellors convened by the Ministry of Education and Culture and th <br/>University Grants Commisson (May 1984) identified value-oriented education as an emerging <br/>area of importance and recommended that value-orientation should be the primary obe <br/>of education at all levels. Subsequenty, in its note on the restructuring of the undergradua <br/>courses, the UGC also issued certain guidelines for the development of the value-onent <br/>component of the Foundation Courses. The High Level Seminar on Moral Education (NCERT. <br/>1981) recommended that value orientation should be the main focus of education and provision <br/>for it should be made throughout the country with due regard for flexibility of approaches. <br/>The National Seminar on Teachers (New Delhi, 1983) addressed itself to the theme of value <br/>education and agreed that there is a great need and urgency for the teaching profession t <br/></p>
<p>give strong value orientation to education at all levels. <br/>Concept <br/>Value education refers to a wide gamut of leamings and activities ranging rom trauning tn <br/></p>
<p>physical health, mental hygiene, etiquette and manners, appropriate soial behaviour, vc <br/>rights and duties to aesthetic and even religious training. </p>

<p>451 objectives <br/>tional objectives refer to explicit formulations of the ways in which students are expected <br/></p>
<p>e changed by the educanve process. That is, the ways in which they will change in ther <br/>hinking, their feellngs ana their actions. Objectives, whether of value education or of any <br/>ur Curricular area depend on a variety of factors-psychological, sociological, <br/>epistemological. <br/></p>
<p>The Difficulty of Specitying Objectives in Value Education At the very outset it should be noted that the field of value education is not only the most <br/>abs eract and controversial, but also the most difficult to handle in concrete terms. A statesman <br/>nay call for loyal, brave, honest citizens; a philosopher for men and women who are truly <br/>res wesDectful of the rights of others and completely tolerant of diversity; a psychologist may list <br/>ortain values concerned, say, with law, life and property, urging that choice involve choosing <br/></p>
<p>hotween these values. Teachers may well agree with all these statements and yet more <br/>pre precise formulaions or well-dehned and specific objectives to be pursued in schools. Values as Objectives <br/>So far as the subject of value education is concerned, values themselves seem to form the <br/>aims of teaching the subject. Attempts have been made from times immemorial to spell out <br/>human values worthy of pursuit. The ancient Hindus recommended the pursuit of three important impersonal values. Truth (Satyam), Goodness (Shivam) and Beauty (Sundaram) <br/>and the four important personal values of Dharma (righteousness), Artha (wealth), Kama (desire) and Moksha (self-realization). The French cherished the values of liberty, equality <br/>and fraternity. The Greeks and the English gave to the world 'democracy' as a value. In themodern world 'scientific temnper' has emerged as a value indispensable to all. World peace' <br/>and 'world citizenship' are also considered as values by many. The teacher of value education has a difficult task in determining the values to be chosen by him for his classroom lessons as <br/>well as tor the co-curricular activities. He should also determine the objectives, both general and specific, in these areas. <br/>Objective of Value Education in the Modern Context <br/>Objectives, especially in value education, have a temporal dimension. Traditionally the objectives of value education were based on religion and philosophy. There was no secular value education and very little scope for the development of moral thinking and the capacity for independent moral decision. In the modern world these are held to be very necessary. Modern society is more complex and there are varieties of social demands made on thepeople. A civilized individual must possess certain minimum social skills. He/She has to establish decent relationship with people with whom he/she has to come across for a short while or for a long duration. He/She may have to transact business in his private or public capacity. He/She has to furnction as a citizen of his/her state, of his/her country and of the World, all at the same time playing appropriate roles in each of these contexts. There are also many other demands made on him/her which need not be enumerated. Value education should therefore it is pointed out, prepare an individual to meet these demands. That these cannot be accomplished in the form of few do's and don'ts of traditional form is quite evident. <br/></p>
<p>The Report of the Joint Study on Education in Asian Countries (JSMEA) lists the following objectives for value education: </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>452 HUMAN PoruLATION AND ENvIRONMINT <br/>1. Full development of child's personality in its physical, mental, emotional and spiritual <br/></p>
<p>aspects. <br/>2. Inculcation of good manners and responsible and co-operative citizenship. <br/>3. Developing respect for the dignity of the individual and the society. <br/>4. Inculcation of a spirit of patriotism and national integration. <br/>5. Developing a democratic way of thinking and living. <br/></p>
<p>Developing tolerance towards and understanding of different religious faiths. <br/>7. Developing a sense of human brotherhood at the social, national and international <br/></p>
<p>levels. <br/>8. Helping children to have faith in some supernatural power and order that is supposed <br/></p>
<p>to control this universe and human life (This applies to the com munities of believers) <br/>9. Enabling children to make moral decisions on the basis of sound moral principles <br/>Further, the report emphasizes certain values at different levels. At the clementary leve, <br/></p>
<p>good manners, orderliness, punctuality, discipline, obedience, piety, cleanliness, co-operation, <br/>truthfulness, honesty, kindness, etc. are mentioned. <br/></p>
<p>At the secondary level, patriotism, dignity of labour, justice, tolerance, human <br/>brotherhood, dignity of the individual, democratic spirit, understanding of other religions, <br/>international understanding, strength of character, ability of making moral judgement, etc. <br/></p>
<p>8. <br/></p>
<p>are mentioned. <br/>The Working Group on value-oriented education has identified five dimensions of value <br/></p>
<p>education. These being physical education, emotional education, mental development, <br/>aesthetic development and the moral and spiritual domain. The values to be pursued in the <br/>moral and spiritual realm, according to them, are <br/></p>
<p>Sincerely, faithfulness, obedience to what one conceives to be the highest, gratitude <br/>honesty, benevolence, generosity, cheerfulness, selflessness, freedom from egoism, equanimity <br/>in joy and suffering, in honour and dishonour success and failure; pursuit of the deepest and <br/></p>
<p>the highest of the absolute and ultimate and the progressive expression of this pursuit in <br/></p>
<p>thought, feeling and action. <br/></p>
<p>In many countries today the emphasis is on socio-economic reconstruction with the <br/>declared intention of a more equitable distribution of the benefits brought about by <br/></p>
<p>modernization. Traditional cultural values have had little time to adjust to certain attr+butes <br/>of modernization. Planners of value education curriculum then are faced with the problems <br/>of identifying values and character traits that will best equip the individual to take his place <br/></p>
<p>in modern society. The objectives of values education should be such that the curriculum <br/></p>
<p>should recognize the tensions that are brought about by the conflicts between tradition and <br/></p>
<p>change. The planned programme should aim at developinga critical value perspective in our <br/></p>
<p>pupils that will enable them to employ modern skills for the betterment of mankind while <br/></p>
<p>helping them renew their commitment to fundamental traditional values. <br/></p>
<p>Religious Dimensions <br/></p>
<p>In countries where strong religious education programmes are supported either by religious <br/></p>
<p>bodies or by the government, it is clearly desirable, even where schools follow different <br/></p>
<p>religious programmes, to have a common value education programme aggreeable to al <br/>bodies engaged in education. </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>453 <br/>HUMAN POPULATION. AND ENvIRONMENT <br/></p>
<p>Value education programmes tor separate religious groups may lead to religious, cultural, al and political prejudice which in pluralist societies may disrupt national unity. In countries SE <br/>with h aSecular education system, the government should consider the contribution which religions can mak ligions  e in developing an effective value education programme. It is believed that od value education programme can be developed without relying on religion. This may he necessary in multi-religious societies and in those where the population is a mixed one o holievers and non-believers. At the same time common teachings of all religions can be used b reinforce values and also teach religious tolerance and understanding to children. For this ntlrpose it is necessary to make a study of the common teachings of different religions and he religious phenomenon asa whole that might be conducive to the value development of children. <br/></p>
<p>tr <br/>Spatial Dimension <br/></p>
<p>An important aspect of value education programmes in all countries relates to the development of the spirit of national identity and patriotism in children. This is necessary for the purpose of integrating and strengthening a nation, especially if it has won its freedom only recently or if its security 1s threatened in some form. But this concern for national identity may Occasionally take the form of national chauvinism and the citizens of a country may develop a feeling that their country is always right. <br/>It has been argued, therefore, that it should be an important objective of value education to make children aware of the fact that the whole world is now a community of interdependent nations that the survival and well-being of the people of the world depends on mutual cooperation. Children should be enabled to appreciable the contributions made to the world's progress by different cultures and made to realize that in the case of various countries coming in conflict with one another, the world would be a very unsafe place to live <br/></p>

<p>Cognitive, Conative and Affective Dimensions <br/>To be educated in the real sen_e of term is to be able to think right, to feel the right kind of emotions and in the desirable manner. Objectives of value education should, therefore, be concerned with all the three phases of personality development as they relate to the right kinds of behaviour. As these phases are themselves interrelated, it would be erroneous to think that value education is exclusively concerned with knowledge, emotion or action alone. To say that 'morality is caught' is to do injustice to the cognitive abilities and training involved in it. Similarly, to equate value education with making students observe certain do's and don'ts would amount to ignoring education of feelings and moral reasoning. The point of mentioning this here is only to draw attention to the multi-dimensional nature of the value education enterprise. <br/>A Conceptual Frame for Value Education <br/>We are now in a position to collect together the points that have emerged out of our discussion of the different aspects of value education and present a synthesis of them thereby suggesting a conceptual frame for the practice of value education. <br/></p>
<p>1. Value education is a highly complex notion. Its meaning and scope ultimately rest on Our conceptions of 'value' and 'education'. <br/>2. Value education essentially is a process of education. It is an education in beliefs, attitudes and values leading to commitment towards right action. It is not the same </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>454 HUMAN PopULATION AND ENVIRONMIENT <br/>as value instruction or value training although it includes the training and instruction <br/>aspects. As value education operates at the level of ideas, beliefs and ideals, is <br/>incompatible with authoritarian indoctrination and transmission of do's and don'ts <br/></p>
<p>3. Value education is education for &quot;becoming' and is concerned with the transformation <br/>of an individual's personality. As such it involves all the three phases of personality <br/>knowing, feeling and doing. The child should be made aware of the right and good <br/>to feel the appropriate emotions and internalize the values in thought and ded <br/>Value education is not synonymous with character training which is only an aspect of <br/>it. Value education also is not social adjustment as it is concerned not so much with <br/>what is but with what ought to be. Value education, again, is not the same as religious <br/></p>
<p>education although religion can serve as a source for value education. <br/></p>
<p>4. Value education programmes should have clear-cut objectives. These objectives span <br/></p>
<p>the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains. To be educated in values is to be <br/>able to think in the right direction, to feel the right kind of emotions and to act in a <br/></p>
<p>desirable manner. These domains are interrelated and are not watertight <br/></p>
<p>compartments. <br/>A good programme of value education should seek to develop in the learner <br/></p>
<p>appropriate value sensibilities, enable him/her to understand and appreciate the <br/></p>
<p>values of democracy, secularism, equality, scientific temper, enable him/her to develop <br/>a concern and commitment for them and provide suitable opportunities for students <br/></p>
<p>to practise and live by these values. <br/></p>
<p>5. Value education should both be substantive and procedural. It should develop in <br/></p>
<p>children the right values and also enable them to think rationally. The values to be <br/></p>
<p>inculcated should represent the best from our tradition and also be in keeping with <br/></p>
<p>the demands of a modernizing society. The core values identified in the National <br/></p>
<p>Policy on Education, 1986, answer to these twin requirements. These are democracy, <br/></p>
<p>secularism, scientific temper, equality, respect for cultural heritage, removal of social <br/></p>
<p>barriers, protection of the environment, history of the freedom movement and <br/></p>
<p>observance of the small family norm. <br/></p>
<p>6. Value education strategies should be related to an individual's stage of value <br/></p>
<p>development, the role of reason, feeling and will in behaviour and the pedagogical <br/></p>
<p>approaches of the direct, indirect and incidental methods. In other words, the strategies <br/></p>
<p>should match the developmental stages of the learner and the objectives being <br/></p>
<p>sought-knowledge, feeling, will. Since education for becoming involves the whole <br/></p>
<p>person, a variety of activities are to be employed-teaching, <br/>instruction, explanation, <br/></p>
<p>discussion, solving value dilemmas, story-telling training of proper habits, sensitization <br/></p>
<p>to value phenomena and providing opportunities to practise the values and live by <br/></p>
<p>them. Delibera te, direct value education should be used cautiously as didactive <br/></p>
<p>approaches have their own limitations. As far as possible value education should be <br/></p>
<p>provided through concrete situations. <br/></p>
<p>7. Apart from direct value education in specially provided periods, there are several <br/></p>
<p>other sources of value education and all these are to be judiciously used. The regular <br/></p>
<p>subjects of the school curriculum are hidden in the discipline <br/>structure and <br/></p>
<p>methodology-a <br/>set of values, attitudes and dispositions. The proper teaching of a <br/></p>
<p>subject involves not only passing on of the information content but also inducing in </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>HUMAN POrULATION AND ENVIRONMENT <br/>55 <br/></p>
<p>the learner the qualities of mind and heart involved in the pursuit of that discipline.Co-curricular activities are another source of value education. Apart from developing the student's creativity and distinctive intellectual, social and cultural interests they also enable them to acquire the values of democratic living, responsibility, co- <br/>operation, tolerance and secularism. The very atmosphere of the school constitules a major source of value education many times. The school atmosphere is the sum total <br/>of the intluences generated by the school, its setting, its traditions and ideals, teachers, <br/>pupils and parents, in one word, the ethos of the school. <br/></p>
<p>8. All education, in a sense, is value education for education is nothing but a process of <br/>transmission of knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that we think as desirable for <br/>the younger generation to have. The entire curriculum designcd to realize the goals <br/>of education acts, therefore, as value education curriculum as well. However, when <br/>we think of value education with specific, reference to direct value education, w <br/>should take note of two factors: what we wish to achieve in the limited provision o time and how. Value education involves learnings of different kinds and its curriculumn <br/>should reflect these learnings in its objectives and organization. The transaction of <br/>the curriculum should also take note of the multi-dimensional nature of value <br/>education. <br/></p>
<p>A variety of instructional materials and aids are to be employed to make value <br/>education purposeful and interesting. Textbooks, general books, newspaper and <br/>magazine articles, anecdotes, charts, models, films, plays all have to be used judiciously <br/>by always keeping in mind the specific objective of value education that is being <br/>sought. The textbook in value education need not take the form of a collection of <br/>lessons' like textbooks in other subjects but can be organized as a handbook of <br/>various kinds of activities with objectives and teaching-learning strategies for the <br/>use of students and/or teachers. <br/></p>
<p>9. Schools have an important role in value education. But their importance should neither <br/>be exaggerated nor denied altogether. Value development will be taking place <br/>constantly both within and outside the school, influenced by a complex network of <br/>environmental factors-home, peer group, media and the community at large. The <br/>extent to which schools function effectively as training grounds for values depends <br/>on their physical condition and the professional idealism of teachers among other <br/>things. To the extent the school factors-teacher-teacher, teacher-pupil, teacher-parent <br/>and the various other group interaction, the school traditions and values, the curricular <br/>and co-curricular activities, the school tone and climate-influence the value <br/></p>
<p>development of children, schools have a responsibility in exercising control over <br/>these and creative conducive conditions for the value development of children. <br/></p>
<p>10. Every teacher is also a value educator. There is no getting away from this fact. The <br/>teacher's task as a value educator is not indoctrination but one of making the students <br/>critically aware of values and understand and appreciate them after rational thought <br/>and deliberation. To do his/her job well the teacher should himself/herself have <br/></p>
<p>personal commitment towards value education and influence his/her charges more <br/>with his/her personal example than precept. This does not mean that the teacher <br/></p>
<p>should be a paragon of virtue or the paradigm of the ideal person. It only means that <br/>the teacher has to be honest in his/her dealings with his/her students and order his/ </p>

<p>her behaviour in accordance with the highest standards and ethics af h. <br/></p>
<p>profession. <br/>11. Any organized educational effort should naturally have its evaluation com <br/></p>
<p>Direct value education should also, therefore, be evaluated in terms of its ohint. <br/>These objectives are not restricted to cognitive learnings alone but cover the af <br/>and psychomotor domains as well. In keeping with the nature of the objecti fective <br/>variety of tools of evaluation may be employed: observation, interview, paper. <br/>pencil tests and so on. Comprehen-sive, objective evaluation in a field like val <br/></p>
<p>ue <br/>education is extremely difficult but every effort must be made to evaluate, informal <br/>and wherever possible, formally, the influence on the desirable growth of child <br/>of the various school inputs-teaching of subjects, direct value education, co-curricgula. <br/></p>
<p>on <br/>activities and teacher-student and student-student interactions. Value education <br/>should not be made an examination subject in the usual sense of the term. <br/></p>
<p>31.14 HIV AND AIDS <br/></p>
<p>Introduction <br/>The most serious public health challenge that the country is facing today is of HTv/AIDS <br/>that is just a decade old in the country. AIDS is a global problem-sadly, with a strono <br/>Indian dimension. <br/></p>
<p>HIV/AIDS has a qualitatively different impact than a traditional health killer such as <br/>malaria. It rips across social structures, targeting young people, particularly girls; by cutting <br/>deep into all sectors of society it undermines vital economic growth-perhaps reducing <br/>future national GDP size in the region by a third over the next twenty years. And by putting <br/>huge additional demand on already weak, hard to access, public services it is seting up the <br/>terms of a desperate conflict over inadequate resources. <br/></p>
<p>In the breadth and depth of its impact, AIDS has revealed the inner workings of poverty. <br/>AlDS creates poverty, AIDS deepens poverty, and AlDS makes poverty harder to escape from. <br/></p>
<p>HIV/AIDS presents major challenges to human survival, human rights and human <br/>development with implications far beyond the health sector. The social and economic <br/>consequences of the epidemic are perhaps one of the most serious threats to sustainable human development. UNDP therefore, promotes and advocates for HIV as a developmental issue. <br/>What are HIV and AIDS? <br/>HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency virus whereas AIDS stands for Acquired Immunity Deficiency Syndrome. <br/></p>
<p>The term &quot;AIDS&quot; describes the conditions and illnesses associated with significant progression of infection with human immunodeficiency virus. It takes 7-10 years to develop after infection with HIV. The HIV is transmitted through infected blood and blood products, infected needles, semen and vaginal fluids, multiple partners, and infected mother to the- baby-before birth, during birth or through breast milk. HIV is passed on by infected people| because the virus is present in the sexual fluids, saliva and blood. Somehow, if infected blood or sexual fluids gets into your blood, you are liable to get infected. If a man/woman having HIV has sex without a condom, infected fluid may gain entry into through a tiny tti: </p>

<p>The various causes of AIDS are as follows: i) Infected blood <br/>(ii) Infected needles <br/>(ii) Multiple partners <br/>iv) Infected mother to her baby before during or after birth. (v) Infected saliva <br/></p>
<p>How to Avoid AIDS <br/>ic pOSsible to avoid AIDS by adopting the following practions. (i) By using condoms <br/></p>
<p>(i) By using syringes <br/>(ii) By avoiding multiple partners i.e., having sex with husband only (iv) By avoiding deep kissing. <br/></p>
<p>Indian Scenario of AIDS <br/>The first case of AIDS in India was reported in 1986 from Chenni. After this there has been <br/>an increase in the number of such cases in all Indian states. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, 3.5 million are living with HIV/AIDS in India. The prevalence of the infection in all parts of the country highlights the spread from urban to rural areas and from high risk to the general population. Migration of labor, low iteracy levels leading to low awareness, gender disparities, poverty and livelihoods issues, lack of health facilities, and prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive tract infections are some of the factors attributed to the spread of HIV/AIDS. While HIV/AIDS threatens all segments of society, it is poor and marginalised people, and in particular women, who are especially vulnerable. A social response of blame, discrimination and stigmatization of HIV positive people can lead to further exclusion of people wh0 are already marginalised. The major risk factors for vulnerability to HIV infection are social and economic dependence. <br/></p>
<p>NACO is implementing India's National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) in partnership with Civil Society Organizations including NGOs, Corporate Sector, Academic institutions ntand networks; Bi and Multi Lateral organizations. <br/>The current phase of NACP i.e. the second phase, has two main strategies with five sub- <br/></p>
<p>ts, Components. The first key strategy is to deliver cost-effective interventions against HIV/ he AIDS through priority targeted interventions for groups at high risk (commercial sex workers, <br/>le anjecting drug users, migrant workers, men having sex with men, and STI clinic attendees), <br/>ed preventive interventions for the general community and low-cost AIDS care. The second <br/>an trategy is strengthening capacity through institutional strengthening and intersectoral <br/>ollaboration. Central issues for NACP are: decentralization and effective partnerships with <br/></p>
<p>vil society organizations (CSOs) including NGOs and Corporate Sector. </p>

<p>Protection of Children and Adolescents from AIDS <br/></p>
<p>In schools and colleges, children and adolescents should be taught, how to avoid HIV infectin. <br/></p>
<p>before they become sexually active. They should be told about condoms, their advantao <br/>and places where they are available. In USA and Canada,these are available in washroo <br/></p>
<p>Most of females in those countries have condoms in their purses. <br/></p>
<p>31.15 WOMEN AND CHILD WELFARE <br/></p>
<p>Women and Children are amongst the most vulnerable sections in any social order. A a <br/>number of them face violence at the hands of the strangers, family members and oth <br/>known to them. Such abuse may take place even at homes and work places. The violen nce <br/></p>
<p>may be in form of psychological abuse and actual physical abuse. Victims in most cases <br/></p>
<p>cannot take recourse to the criminal justice system for a variety of reasons including the fea <br/>of social stigma and lack of knowledge about the institutions, that could come to their Scue. <br/></p>
<p>The department of women and child development is one of the major departments in tha <br/></p>
<p>district implementing variety of programmes for the development of women &amp; children <br/></p>
<p>The main objective includes development of women and children, protecting children from <br/></p>
<p>being neglected., exploited, prevent destitution and delinquency, provide alternative shelter <br/></p>
<p>based rehabilitation through institutional treatment, improve health nutritional status af <br/></p>
<p>children and women, create awareness among rural women to improve overall livine <br/></p>
<p>conditions. <br/>Schemes of the Department <br/></p>
<p>i) Attendence scholarship for girls upto 10th standard. <br/></p>
<p>(i') Assistance to girls in job oriented courses &amp;encouragement to take up self <br/></p>
<p>employment through bank loans under schemes like Vikasini, Navajeevan, Mane <br/>Belaku, Udyogini etc. <br/></p>
<p>(ii) Special schools for child labour, physical handicapped children. <br/></p>
<p>iv) Providing scholarship to disabled students and encouraging them for self <br/></p>
<p>employment. <br/>(v)Widow/Devadasi marriage. <br/></p>
<p>(vi) Assistance to mahila mandals and mahila federations. <br/></p>
<p>Following are the high-lights of children welfare <br/></p>
<p>i) All children have the right to love understanding. <br/>(ii) Children should be provided nutritious food. <br/></p>
<p>(iii) Children should be given free medical care. <br/></p>
<p>(iv) Children should be provided ventilated houses. <br/></p>
<p>(v)Children should be given free education so that they grow well on all fronts. <br/></p>
<p>(vi) The child welfare mandate should be expanded to include child exposure to <br/></p>
<p>environment. <br/></p>
<p>We should learn from Canada. This country gives nearly $200 every month to every <br/></p>
<p>child. They provide free education and medical facilities to every child. <br/></p>
<p>As important as civil and political rights in the Indian context are the rights ot the <br/>* <br/></p>
<p>marginalised-women, tribals, Dalits or lower-castes, and the poor whose survival depends </p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>HUMAN PoPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT <br/>459 <br/></p>
<p>on access to natural resources. It is the rights of the marginalised and of the minorities in the country today that are in peril. The challenge is to empower the poor and marginalised to demand their rights and participate in the public sphere. <br/>31.16 ROLE OF INFORMATION IN ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH Information technology (IT) has made environmentalist to gather informations and forecasts the disasters quickly. The environmentalist could collect information world wide by using IT on his table and make use of the same as per his requirements. By using GIS (Geogaphic Information System) and GP'S (Global Positioning System) they could access to a large amount of information alongwith pholographs. <br/></p>
<p>In India, Government in 1982 set up ENVIS (Environment Information System) which is decentralised information system network and uses its activities in collection, storage, retrieval and dissemination of environmental information to environmentalist, engineers, decision nakers, policy planners, scientists, research workers, health engineers, and general public all over the country. ENVIS network also includes 13 subject oriented centres, known as ENVIS centres which have been set up in the various institutions/origanisations of the country in the priority areas of environment such as pollution control, environmental technology, energy, toxic chemicals, biodegradation of wastes, desertification, estuuary mangroves, corals and lagoons, media and environment. <br/>Now ENVIS has been upgraded to act as National Focal Point (NFP) and Regional Service Centre (RSC) for South Asia sub-regional countries by INFOTERA which is an International Reference System for Sources of Information on Environment under the United Nation Environment Programme (UNEP). It provides environmental information to the national and international community. NFP-ENVIS have isolated more than 500 Indian Potential Sources in the International directory of UNEP. These sources provide information in the field of environment and its related areas. </p>
